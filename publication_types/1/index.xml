      <title>The Effects of Shifting Priorities and Capacity on Policy Work and Constituency Service</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/correspondence/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When elected officials gain power, do they use it to provide more constituent service or affect policy? The answer informs debates over how legislator capacity, term limits, and institutional positions affect legislator behavior.  We distinguish two countervailing effects of increased institutional power: shifting priorities and increased capacity.  To assess how institutional power shapes behavior, we assemble a massive new database of 611,239 legislator requests to a near census of federal departments, agencies, and sub-agencies between 2007 and 2020. We find that legislators prioritize policy work as they gain institutional power (e.g., become a committee chair) but simultaneously maintain their levels of constituency service. Moreover, when a new legislator replaces an experienced legislator, the district receives less constituency service &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; less policy work. Rather than long-serving and powerful elected officials diverting attention from constituents, their increased capacity enables them to maintain levels of constituency service, even as they prioritize policy work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Public Pressure and Congressional Oversight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass public engagement into models of congressional oversight and bureaucratic policymaking? This paper develops and tests theories about the roles of individuals, organizations, legislators, and lobbying coalitions in bureaucratic policymaking. I argue that congressional oversight is often mobilized by broader lobbying campaigns. Pressure campaigns mobilize individuals to pressure executive-branch policymakers, both directly and indirectly by mobilizing members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data and Methods for Analyzing Special Interest Influence in Rulemaking</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/regdata/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US government creates astonishingly complete records of policy creation in executive agencies. In this article, we describe the major kinds of data that have proven useful to scholars studying interest group behavior and influence in bureaucratic politics, how to obtain them, and challenges that we as users have encountered in working with these data. We discuss established databases such as regulations.gov, which contains comments on draft agency rules, and newer sources of data, such as ex-parte meeting logs, which describe the interest groups and individual lobbyists that bureaucrats are meeting face-to-face about proposed policies. One challenge is that much of these data are not machine-readable. We argue that scholars should invest in several projects to make these datasets machine-readable and to link them to each other as well as to other databases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inequality in Administrative Democracy</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/finreg/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Research on inequality overlooks administrative policymaking, where most U.S. law is currently made, under pressure from vast flows of money, lobbying, and political mobilization. Analyzing a new database of over 260,000 comments on agency rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, we identify the lobbying activities of over 6,000 organizations. Leveraging measures of organizations’ wealth, participation in administrative politics, sophistication, and lobbying success, we provide the first large-scale assessment of wealth-based inequality in agency rulemaking. We find that wealthier organizations are more likely to participate in rulemaking and enjoy more success in shifting the content of federal agency rules. These patterns are not explained by membership differentials. More profit-driven organizations are also more likely to participate and enjoy more success in shifting the content of federal agency rules. Wealthier organizations’ ability to marshal legal and technical expertise appears to be a key mechanism by which wealth leads to lobbying success.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making Policy About Distributive Justice</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/ej/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Political movements shape policy agendas, often reframing policy debates in distributive justice terms.  To examine how this affects policymaking, I assess the aggregate impact of environmental justice advocacy on U.S. federal policy from 1993 to 2020 using a new dataset of 13,179 draft and final rule pairs from 40 agencies and 42 million public comments on these rules. I find that when groups raise distributive justice concerns, final rules more often change to address these concerns. Supporting theories about how institutions affect receptivity to issue frames, agencies with processes for addressing environmental justice are more responsive. The scale of mobilization also matters; when larger coalitions raise environmental justice concerns, policy texts are more likely to change. However, within the movement, elite organizations have more lobbying success. These findings suggest that policymaking is systematically affected by which groups make distributive justice claims, their alignment with institutional biases, and the levels of public pressure they mobilize.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mapping Literature with Networks: An Application to Redistricting</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/netlit/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the gaps and connections across existing theories and findings is a perennial challenge in scientific research.
Systematically reviewing scholarship is especially challenging for researchers who may lack domain expertise, including junior scholars or those exploring new substantive territory.
Conversely, senior scholars may rely on longstanding assumptions and social networks that exclude new research.
In both cases, ad hoc literature reviews hinder accumulation of knowledge. Scholars are rarely systematic in selecting relevant prior work or then identifying patterns across their sample.
To encourage systematic, replicable, and transparent methods for assessing literature, we propose an accessible network-based framework for reviewing scholarship.
In our method, we consider a literature as a network of recurring concepts (nodes) and theorized relationships among them (edges).
Network statistics and visualization allow researchers to see patterns and offer reproducible characterizations of assertions about the major themes in existing literature.
Critically, our approach is systematic and powerful but also low-cost; it requires researchers to enter relationships they observe in prior studies into a simple spreadsheet — a task accessible to new and experienced researchers alike.
Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/judgelord/netlit&#34;&gt;open-source R package, &lt;code&gt;netlit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enables researchers to leverage powerful network analysis while minimizing software-specific knowledge.
We demonstrate this approach by reviewing redistricting literature.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Measuring Change and Influence in Budget Texts</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/budgets/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://judgelord.github.io/research/budgets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a dataset of over 100,000 pages of discussion about how U.S. federal budget line
items ought to be used and explores how well a variety of methods commonly used to identify similarity,
difference, and influence among texts travel to this new context.  Ultimately, it aims to test theories about
the role of the executive branch in influencing the policy agenda for congressional appropriations and the
role of Congress in influencing the policy agenda of executive agencies.  This involves two methodological
exercises.  First I contrast several approaches to measure similarity and differences in policy texts were we
have strong intuitions about their relationships.  For example, we expect presidential transitions to affect
the content of the president’s annual budget. Different text analysis methods give us different perspectives
on the magnitude and substance of change.  Second, it outlines an approach for estimating the relative
influence of texts on a change in a policy document, for example, the influence of the president’s budget
on congressional appropriations committee reports and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Racialization and Perceived Institutional Ideology</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/racialization/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://judgelord.github.io/research/racialization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While traditional measures of liberal-conservative ideology have long shaped our understanding of public institutions, they often miss a critical dimension: racialization.
Racialization, as we define it, refers to the extent to which institutions are framed and discussed in relation to race.
Racialization reflects an institution&amp;rsquo;s perceived role in shaping racial inequality and political conflicts.
Yet, we lack systematic measures of institutional racialization.
Using text analysis of policy documents, media coverage, and advocacy reports, we develop new measures for the racialization of federal agencies.
We find that racialization is not correlated with perceived liberal or conservative ideology.
However, agencies perceived as more ideologically extreme&amp;mdash;whether liberal or conservative&amp;mdash;tend to be more racialized.
Agencies involved in immigration enforcement are highly racialized and perceived as conservative, while others, like the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services, are also racialized but perceived as liberal.
We also find significant variation in racialization over time, suggesting that efforts to frame or reform agencies affect racialization, even when the agency&amp;rsquo;s mission and work remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Climate Movement&#39;s Impact on Technocratic Policymaking</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/cj/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Social movements play a critical role in advancing landmark statutes. Likewise, lack
of movement pressure is a leading explanation for the failure of policy eﬀorts. Yet, we
have little systematic evidence about the impact of social movements on policy. To
what extent do movements shape the thousands of policies that governments make
every year? I examine how social movements aﬀect policymaking by assessing the
climate movement’s impact on 20 thousand policy documents from 24 U.S. federal
agencies. Leveraging a new dataset of 40 million public comments on these policies,
I find that when public comments raise climate or climate justice concerns, these
concerns are more likely to be addressed in the final rule. Eﬀect sizes vary across
agencies, possibly due to the alignment of climate and climate justice issue frames with
agency missions. The magnitude of public pressure also matters. When more groups
and individuals raise climate and climate justice concerns, policy texts are more likely
to change, even when controlling for overall levels of public attention. These findings
suggest that public pressure for recognizing both scientific and distributive justice
claims systematically aﬀects policymaking. Finally, public comments oﬀer a new lens
to assess the rise, institutionalization, and impact of the climate justice movement
within the broader climate and environmental justice movements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Do Agencies (Sometimes) Get So Much Mail?</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/whymail/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://judgelord.github.io/research/whymail/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why. Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups. Yet agencies occasionally receive thousands, even millions, of comments
from ordinary people. How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass participation
into models of bureaucratic policymaking? Are public pressure campaigns, like other
lobbying tactics, primarily used by well-resourced groups to create an impression of
public support? Or are they better understood as conflict expansion tactics used by
less-resourced groups? To answer these questions, I collect and analyze millions of public comments on draft agency rules. Using text analysis methods underlying plagiarism
detection, I match individual public comments to pressure-group campaigns. Contrary
to other forms of lobbying, I find that mass comment campaigns are almost always a
conflict expansion tactic rather than well-resourced groups creating an impression of
public support. Most public comments are mobilized by public interest organizations,
not by narrow private interests or astroturf campaigns. However, the resources and
capacities required to launch a campaign cause a few larger policy advocacy organizations to dominate. Over 80 percent of public comments were mobilized by just 100
organizations, most of which lobby in the same public interest coalitions. As a result,
the public attention that pressure campaigns generate is concentrated on a small portion of policies on which these organizations focus. I also find no evidence of negativity
bias in public comments. Instead, most commenters supported draft policies during
the Obama administration but opposed those of the Trump administration, reflecting
the partisan biases of mobilizing groups.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Words and Deeds: Do Legislators&#39; Public Messages Reflect Their Behind-the-Scenes Work with Federal Agencies?</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/corinbox/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://judgelord.github.io/research/corinbox/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do legislators’ words match their deeds?
We contribute to the promise-keeping literature by introducing “attention consistency” as a measure of representation, theorizing conditions that should produce more consistency between public messaging and behavior in office, and testing whether legislators’ public attention to federal agencies in constituent newsletters corresponds to their private engagement with those agencies.
We find strong evidence of attention consistency in cross-sectional and within-member analyses in the volume of legislators&amp;rsquo; attention.
Robustness checks evaluating the distribution of legislator attention yield similar results.
Legislators who publicly emphasize an agency engage more with that agency behind the scenes.
We find no evidence that ideological distance from an agency conditions the consistency of legislators&amp;rsquo; public and private attention to it.
Similarly, while members of relevant oversight committees make more requests of agencies they oversee, we find no evidence that oversight membership conditions the consistency of legislators&amp;rsquo; public and private attention to it.
Our analyses show that legislators&amp;rsquo; interests, as expressed in their attention to that agency in their newsletters, matter as much as institutional roles in shaping legislators&amp;rsquo; behind-the-scenes interactions with federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
