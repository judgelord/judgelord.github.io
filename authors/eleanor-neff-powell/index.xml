      <title>The Effects of Shifting Priorities and Capacity on Policy Work and Constituency Service</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/correspondence/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When elected officials gain power, do they use it to provide more constituent service or to affect broad public policies? Answering this question informs debates over
how legislator capacity, term limits, and institutional power affect political representation. We distinguish two countervailing effects of increased institutional power. First,
as elected officials gain power, they allocate relatively more effort to policy over constituency service. Second, institutional power provides additional resources and therefore increases their overall capacity. To assess the extent to which these countervailing
effects of institutional power affect behavior, we assemble a massive new database of
487,890 Congressional requests to federal agencies between 2007 and 2018 obtained
through 429 FOIA requests, a near census of departments, agencies, and sub-agencies.
We find that most legislator contacts with the bureaucracy are constituency service,
regardless of institutional position and tenure. Leveraging variation within legislatoragency pairs, we show that legislators prioritize policy work as they gain power and
experience, but increasing overall capacity enables them to maintain levels of constituency service. Consistent with our theory that service depends on capacity, we
show that new legislators do less policy work and constituency service than their more
senior colleagues. In a series of robustness checks, we show that our findings are not
the result of exogenous variation in constituent demand. Rather than long-serving and
powerful elected officials diverting attention from their district, their increased capacity
enables them to maintain levels of constituency service, even as they prioritize policy
work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Legislator Advocacy on Behalf of Constituents and Corporate Donors</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/ferc/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We use letters that legislators write to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study congressional attempts to influence bureaucratic decisions. Analyzing thousands of letters that legislators sent
to the agency over nearly two decades, we find that these letters are filled with specific references to
companies that legislators seek to assist or about which the legislator’s constituents have complaints. We
explore which legislators seek to influence the agency, on whose behalf legislators advocate, and the kinds
of outcomes they attempt to influence. We find that most individual constituent letters oppose proposed
energy projects, but most non-constituent letters advocate in favor of named businesses. Finally, we
assess whether legislators’ advocacy behavior is related to the campaign contributions they receive from
the energy industry. We find that Republicans and those who receive money from the energy sector
write to advocate for energy companies, but not their constituents, while Democrats write comparatively
more letters in opposition to energy companies. Campaign contributions are much stronger predictors of
pro-business advocacy than other kinds of attention to energy issues, such as energy-related constituency
service or advocacy against energy projects. For example, a legislator who receives $200,000 from the
energy sector is twice as likely to write advocating on behalf of an energy company than a legislator
who received no energy-sector money but no more likely to write on behalf of their constituents or in
opposition to an energy project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Who Gets Constituent Service?</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/correp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We leverage a massive new comprehensive database of constituent service requests from Members of Congress to examine which types of constituents receive help from Members of Congress and how electing a Republican or Democrat affects who gets served. We find that the amount of help that legislators provide veterans and seniors aligns with the number of veterans and seniors in their district. However, the share of low-income constituents does not predict the amount of help that legislators provide to constituents seeking help during hardship. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that Republicans provide less constituency service than Democrats overall. We fail to detect partisan differences in the amount of service to businesses, veterans, or seniors, but we find that Republicans provide much less service to low-income individuals. We offer potential explanations for this disparity, including demand from constituents and elected officials&#39; willingness to supply it.  Our results show that elections have consequences for the provision of service to constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
