      <title>The Effects of Shifting Priorities and Capacity on Policy Work and Constituency Service</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/correspondence/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When elected officials gain power, do they use it to provide more constituent service or to affect broad public policies? Answering this question informs debates over
how legislator capacity, term limits, and institutional power affect political representation. We distinguish two countervailing effects of increased institutional power. First,
as elected officials gain power, they allocate relatively more effort to policy over constituency service. Second, institutional power provides additional resources and therefore increases their overall capacity. To assess the extent to which these countervailing
effects of institutional power affect behavior, we assemble a massive new database of
487,890 Congressional requests to federal agencies between 2007 and 2018 obtained
through 429 FOIA requests, a near census of departments, agencies, and sub-agencies.
We find that most legislator contacts with the bureaucracy are constituency service,
regardless of institutional position and tenure. Leveraging variation within legislatoragency pairs, we show that legislators prioritize policy work as they gain power and
experience, but increasing overall capacity enables them to maintain levels of constituency service. Consistent with our theory that service depends on capacity, we
show that new legislators do less policy work and constituency service than their more
senior colleagues. In a series of robustness checks, we show that our findings are not
the result of exogenous variation in constituent demand. Rather than long-serving and
powerful elected officials diverting attention from their district, their increased capacity
enables them to maintain levels of constituency service, even as they prioritize policy
work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data and Methods for Analyzing Special Interest Influence in Rulemaking</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/regdata/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US government creates astonishingly complete records of policy creation in executive agencies. In this article, we describe the major kinds of data that have proven useful to scholars studying interest group behavior and influence in bureaucratic politics, how to obtain them, and challenges that we as users have encountered in working with these data. We discuss established databases such as regulations.gov, which contains comments on draft agency rules, and newer sources of data, such as ex-parte meeting logs, which describe the interest groups and individual lobbyists that bureaucrats are meeting face-to-face about proposed policies. One challenge is that much of these data are not machine-readable. We argue that scholars should invest in several projects to make these datasets machine-readable and to link them to each other as well as to other databases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inequality in Administrative Democracy</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/finreg/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Research on inequality overlooks administrative policymaking, where most U.S. law is currently made, under pressure from vast flows of money, lobbying, and political mobilization. Analyzing a new database of over 260,000 comments on agency rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, we identify the lobbying activities of over 6,000 organizations. Leveraging measures of organizations’ wealth, participation in administrative politics, sophistication, and lobbying success, we provide the first large-scale assessment of wealth-based inequality in agency rulemaking. We find that wealthier organizations are more likely to participate in rulemaking and enjoy more success in shifting the content of federal agency rules. These patterns are not explained by membership differentials. More profit-driven organizations are also more likely to participate and enjoy more success in shifting the content of federal agency rules. Wealthier organizations’ ability to marshal legal and technical expertise appears to be a key mechanism by which wealth leads to lobbying success.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making Policy About Distributive Justice</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/ej/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://judgelord.github.io/research/ej/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Political movements shape policy agendas, often reframing policy debates in distributive justice terms.  To examine how this affects policymaking, I assess the aggregate impact of environmental justice advocacy on U.S. federal policy from 1993 to 2020 using a new dataset of 13,179 draft and final rule pairs from 40 agencies and 42 million public comments on these rules. I find that when groups raise distributive justice concerns, final rules more often change to address these concerns. Supporting theories about how institutions affect receptivity to issue frames, agencies with processes for addressing environmental justice are more responsive. The scale of mobilization also matters; when larger coalitions raise environmental justice concerns, policy texts are more likely to change. However, within the movement, elite organizations have more lobbying success. These findings suggest that policymaking is systematically affected by which groups make distributive justice claims, their alignment with institutional biases, and the levels of public pressure they mobilize.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Do Agencies (Sometimes) Get So Much Mail?</title>
      <link>https://judgelord.github.io/research/whymail/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why. Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups. Yet agencies occasionally receive thousands, even millions, of comments
from ordinary people. How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass participation
into models of bureaucratic policymaking? Are public pressure campaigns, like other
lobbying tactics, primarily used by well-resourced groups to create an impression of
public support? Or are they better understood as conflict expansion tactics used by
less-resourced groups? To answer these questions, I collect and analyze millions of public comments on draft agency rules. Using text analysis methods underlying plagiarism
detection, I match individual public comments to pressure-group campaigns. Contrary
to other forms of lobbying, I find that mass comment campaigns are almost always a
conflict expansion tactic rather than well-resourced groups creating an impression of
public support. Most public comments are mobilized by public interest organizations,
not by narrow private interests or astroturf campaigns. However, the resources and
capacities required to launch a campaign cause a few larger policy advocacy organizations to dominate. Over 80 percent of public comments were mobilized by just 100
organizations, most of which lobby in the same public interest coalitions. As a result,
the public attention that pressure campaigns generate is concentrated on a small portion of policies on which these organizations focus. I also find no evidence of negativity
bias in public comments. Instead, most commenters supported draft policies during
the Obama administration but opposed those of the Trump administration, reflecting
the partisan biases of mobilizing groups.&lt;/p&gt;
