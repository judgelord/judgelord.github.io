As a fourth-year doctoral candidate, the Fellowship would support the final year of my Ph.D. research and a year of post-doctoral research.\nResearch concept Political scientists have long studied how social movements influence elected officials, but we have much to learn about how activists and public pressure may influence bureaucratic policymaking and the role that tactics like mass-comment campaigns play in movement-building. My dissertation examines how advocacy organizations mobilize supporters to amplify more technical lobbying efforts. I focus on agency rulemaking, where most U.S. law is now made, and where organizations like UCS often mobilize thousands of people to engage. To the extent that this tactic aims to influence policy, it presumes that policymakers are more likely to respond to demands amplified by mass mobilization campaigns. While plausible that mass engagement may affect agency decisions both directly, by realizing latent public demands, and indirectly, by influencing elected officials whose opinions matter to agency policymakers, these hypotheses remain untested. We know very little about the conditions under which mass mobilization aimed at bureaucratic policymaking succeeds and the mechanisms by which it may affect policy.\nMy research begins to fill this gap. I develop systematic measures of public engagement in rulemaking over time using text reuse and Bayesian classifiers to link millions of public comments to the advocacy efforts they support. I then use my new measures of public engagement to assess the effects of mobilization on policy by linking changes in policy texts and the policymaking process to the demands of each coalition. For example, in preliminary work for a chapter on the influence of environmental justice (EJ) activists in rulemaking, I compare the preambles of draft and final rules and analyze the comments submitted on each rule. I identify 21,544 draft agency rules that plausibly affect EJ issues but do not mention “environmental justice.’’ In comments submitted on 1,496 of these draft rules, commenters raised “environmental justice” as a concern. When they did, agencies were more likely to add EJ language when publishing the final rule. This suggests that advocacy efforts may indeed influence rulemaking. While I have yet to find an effect for the volume of public comments, I am developing more sophisticated methods to better test the hypothesis that agencies are more likely to respond to demands amplified by mass mobilization campaigns.\nA second part of my dissertation explores how and when Members of Congress are mobilized to engage in agency decisions. Here, I collaborate with Eleanor Powell and Justin Grimmer, leading scholars on legislator behavior. Through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests, we created a new dataset of hundreds of thousands of letters, emails, and phone calls from legislators to bureaucrats. I use this dataset to identify how advocacy campaigns mobilize or “scare off’” legislator engagement in agency decisions.\nThe Kendall Fellowship would also allow me to advance a third key part of this research agenda: assessing how different tactics mobilize individuals and elected officials and ultimately affect policy. Specifically, I hope to collaborate with organizations like UCS in two ways. First, I hope to integrate data on responses to public engagement campaigns, such as click-through rates for action alerts, data on those engaged, and any personalized text they added. I see these as key to measuring the intensity of public demands and the potential for movements to spread. Second, I hope to help design small randomly-assigned variations in future mobilization efforts—for example, messaging with and without an EJ frame—and use the methods I developed in my dissertation to track legislator and agency responses. Eventually, I hope to collect sufficient experimental evidence to causally identify effects of public engagement on policy, but the results of even a few experimental manipulations may reveal mechanisms of influence.\n Experience I hold master’s degrees in Environmental Science and Political Science and have significant research and policy experience beyond academia.\nFrom 2009 to 2011, I developed and led a collaborative initiative for Willamette Partnership, a watershed-based nonprofit. This involved convening groups of experts, advocates, and policymakers to draft agency guidance and state law around Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act regulations and Farm Bill Conservation Title criteria. I also helped develop strategic plans for Willamette Partnership, and for the Oregon Sierra Club in my role as Vice Chair of the Columbia Chapter, and I would be excited to help plan the Center for Science and Democracy’s future efforts to empower the scientific community and our supporters.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, I worked for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, analyzing changes in forestry laws. This research emerged from my M.E.Sc. work, where I wrote a book chapter tracing the effects of U.S. NGOs and indigenous activists on forestry laws and a journal article on the evolution of initiatives like the Forest Stewardship Council.\nSince 2015, I have been working on my Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin where I currently teach a class on statistical computing for Ph.D. students. I also hold positions in the Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences and the American Political Science Association’s Science, Technology, and Environmental Politics section.\nAs an organization that mobilizes supporters to amplify science and realize latent public demands, UCS, and the Center for Science and Democracy offer an ideal environment to advance my research.\nThank you so much for your consideration,\nDevin Judge-Lord\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b44e40bff843759f4d95115932da074e","permalink":"/templates/rmd-templates/djl-letter/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/templates/rmd-templates/djl-letter/","section":"templates","summary":"To whom it may concern:\nI write to apply for the Kendall Fellowship in Understanding Scientist Activism and Movement Building.

We build on Arnold (1979)’s insights into how bureaucrats and legislators anticipate how others will react to their actions. Drawing on thousands of letters from legislators to the agency sent over nearly two decades, we find that these letters are filled with specific references to companies that legislators seek to assist or about which the legislator’s constituents have complaints. We explore which legislators seek to influence the agency, on whose behalf they make requests, and what outcome they attempt to influence. Finally, we match these letters with campaign finance records to see whether legislators’ behavior correlates with the campaign contributions they receive from the energy industry. We find that Republicans and those who receive money from the energy-sector write relatively more letters on behalf of energy companies, but not on behalf of constituents, while Democrats write comparatively more letters in opposition to energy companies.","tags":null,"title":"Campaign Contributions and Bureaucratic Oversight","type":"research"},{"authors":["Devin Judge-Lord","Constance McDermott","Ben Cashore"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"dc3eb832b43cab6c28a545b98824bae7","permalink":"/research/fsc-sfi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/fsc-sfi/","section":"research","summary":"Methods to measure regulatory stringency and a comparison of forest certification programs.","tags":["private governance","forestry"],"title":"Do Private Regulations 'Ratchet Up?'","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"76c302fa0fdb0222edfae10010674227","permalink":"/project/correspondence/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/correspondence/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Devin Judge-Lord"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7f23ffac670c9cdcc8426a5b075da998","permalink":"/research/budgets/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/budgets/","section":"research","summary":"This paper introduces a dataset of over 100,000 pages of discussion about how U.S. federal budget line items ought to be used and explores how well a variety of methods commonly used to identify similarity, difference, and influence among texts travel to this new context.  Ultimately, it aims to test theories about the role of the executive branch in influencing the policy agenda for congressional appropriations and the role of Congress in influencing the policy agenda of executive agencies.  This involves two methodological exercises.  First I contrast several approaches to measure similarity and differences in policy texts were we have strong intuitions about their relationships.  For example, we expect presidential transitions to affect the content of the president’s annual budget. Different text analysis methods give us different perspectives on the magnitude and substance of change.  Second, it outlines an approach for estimating the relative influence of texts on a change in a policy document, for example, the influence of the president’s budget on congressional appropriations committee reports and vice versa.","tags":null,"title":"Measuring Change and Influence in Budget Texts","type":"research"},{"authors":["Devin Judge-Lord"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1a9cc261bf2cd37652c1a44881e18e35","permalink":"/research/ej/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/ej/","section":"research","summary":"I explore the role of public comments in rulemaking by focusing on their role in the environmental justice movement. Environmental justice concerns focus on the unequal access to healthy environments and protection from harms caused by things like pollution and climate change. The ways in which agencies consider environmental justice highlights how rulemaking has distributive consequences, how the public comment process creates a political community, and how claims raised by activists are addressed. Examining over 20,000 rulemaking processes at agencies known to address environmental justice concerns, I find that when public comments raise environmental justice concerns, these concerns are more likely to be addressed in the final rule. Effects vary across agencies, possibly due to the alignment of environmental justice aims with agency missions. While we cannot infer that agencies addressing environmental justice concerns is caused by the public comments themselves, comments may be a good proxy for mobilization in general. Furthermore, the correlation between mobilization and policy changes is largest and most significant in agencies with missions focused on environmental and distributional policy, i.e. the kinds of agencies we may expect to be most responsive to environmental justice concerns.","tags":null,"title":"Social Movements, Science, Bureaucracy, and Democracy","type":"research"},{"authors":["Devin Judge-Lord"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ad1304e10bb599697a3bdc5173935a80","permalink":"/research/correspondence/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/correspondence/","section":"research","summary":"Representation in Congress is based, in part, on legislators’ ability to assist their constituents with the federal bureaucracy. Constituency service is central to definitions of representation as well as empirical explanations for phenomena such a the incumbency advantage. And yet, too little is known about when and how elected officials contact the bureaucracy on behalf of their constituents. We assemble a massive new database of over 150,000 Congressional requests to agencies between 2007 and 2017 obtained through over 250 FOIA requests, approaching a census of all contacts with the bureaucracy. We examine when legislators contact agencies, which legislators contact those agencies, and the purpose of the contact, showing that as legislators gain power in Washington they often expand their constituency service work, even as they expand their policy work. This suggests that perceived trade-offs constituents may face between influential and attentive representatives is a false choice. Instead, what matters is picking representatives who efficiently use the resources of their office.","tags":null,"title":"Unequal Representation: Constituency Service in Today’s Congress","type":"research"},{"authors":["Devin Judge-Lord"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"df438615a5d2d855db20593354b032a7","permalink":"/research/defrence/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/defrence/","section":"research","summary":"I investigate the conventional wisdom that courts are more likely to uphold federal agency policies made through notice-and-comment rulemaking. I find that Supreme Court Justices have different preferences for deference, but overall, are actually less likely to show deference in rulemaking cases. However, the evidence does not suggest that this is due to justices voting more ideologically due to the greater stakes in rulemaking cases as implied by previous research. I then investigate potential selection effects at the circuit court and certiorari stages that could cause rulemaking cases to lose at the Supreme Court. The results offer no evidence that deference differs between circuit courts and the Supreme Court. While the Supreme Court may disproportionately opt to review rulemaking cases, it does not appear to do this in order to systematically discipline lower courts. Finally, I examine elements of the rulemaking process itself that may affect judicial review. Greater participation in rulemaking correlates with deference, as does an agency’s choice to regulate less rather than more. The puzzling negative relationship between rulemaking and deference remains unresolved, but, contrary to previous research, preliminary results suggest that justices may defer more to agency rulemaking on more salient issues where stakes are highest.","tags":null,"title":"Why Courts Defer to Administrative Agency Judgement","type":"research"},{"authors":["Devin Judge-Lord"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"46c6cf6e682e93274c9154e5ccea32c1","permalink":"/research/whymail/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/whymail/","section":"research","summary":"Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups. Yet agencies occasionally receive thousands or even millions of comments from ordinary people. Why? Why do individuals engage when they seemingly have no new information to offer and no power to influence decisions? Who inspires them and to what end? How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass participation into models of bureaucratic policymaking? I argue that mass mobilizing is an attractive and potentially influential tactic because produces political information about the coalition that mobilized it. I measure the scale and intensity of public support for proposed policies and examine alternative explanations that mass mobilization is (1) a conflict expansion tactic, where coalitions with fewer resources leverage public support, or (2) a more conventional lobbying tactic, where groups with superior resources leverage these resources to create an impression of public support. To link individual comments to the more sophisticated lobbying efforts they support, I use text reuse and clustering methods to identify formal and informal coalitions. I also classify different types of supporters. Using these new measures of political mobilization and engagement in agency rulemaking, I find that, in contrast to conventional insider lobbying, the vast majority of mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking is mobilized by public interest group coalitions.","tags":null,"title":"Why do agencies (sometimes) get so much mail?","type":"research"}]
