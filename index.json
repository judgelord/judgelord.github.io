Public comment periods on proposed policies purport to provide democratic accountability. Yet theories of bureaucratic policymaking largely ignore the occasional bursts of civic engagement that generate the vast majority of public comments on proposed rules. To fill this gap, I build and test theories about the role of public pressure in policymaking. I collect and analyze millions of public comments to develop the first systematic measures of civic engagement and influence in bureaucratic policymaking. Four substantive chapters address (1) how and why advocacy groups mobilize ordinary people to engage in rulemaking; (2) how public pressure draws the attention of elected officials; (3) how public pressure impacts policy outcomes; and (4) how the environmental justice movement has used opportunities to participate in rulemaking to affect policy.\nThe first chapter (Why Do Agencies (Sometimes) Get So Much Mail?), addresses who participates in public pressure campaigns and why. Are public pressure campaigns, like other lobbying tactics, primarily used by well-resourced groups to create an impression of public support? Or are they better understood as conflict expansion tactics used by less-resourced groups? To answer these questions, I collect and analyze millions of public comments on draft agency rules. Using text analysis methods underlying plagiarism detection, I match individual public comments to pressure-group campaigns. I find that most public comments are mobilized by a few public interest organizations. Over 80% of the 48 million comments on proposed rules posted to regulations.gov were mobilized by just 100 organizations, 87 of which lobby in coalitions with each other. Contrary to other forms of lobbying, I find that mass comment campaigns are almost always a conflict expansion tactic, rather than well-resourced groups creating an impression of public support. Contrary to other forms of political participation, I find no evidence of negativity bias in public comments. Indeed, from 2005 to 2017, most comments supported proposed rules. This is because public comments tend to support Democratic policies and oppose Republican policies, reflecting the asymmetry in mobilizing groups.\nThe second substantive chapter examines the effect of public pressure campaigns on congressional oversight. I assess whether legislators are more likely to engage in rulemaking when advocacy groups mobilize public pressure. This involves collecting and coding thousands of comments from Members of Congress on proposed rules with and without public pressure campaigns. These data also allow me to assess congressional oversight as a mediator in policy influence, i.e., the extent to which public pressure campaigns affect agency decisionmakers directly or indirectly through their effects on elected officials’ oversight behaviors.\nIn a third chapter, I use a mix of hand-coding and computational text analysis methods to assess whether public pressure campaigns increase lobbying success in agency rulemaking. To measure lobbying success, I develop computational methods to identify lobbying coalitions and estimate lobbying success for all rules posted for comment on regulations.gov. These methods are validated against a random sample of 100 rules with a mass-comment campaign and 100 rules without a mass comment campaign that I hand-code for whether each coalition got the policy outcome they sought. I then assess potential mechanisms by which mass public engagement may affect policy. Each mechanism involves a distinct type of information revealed to decisionmakers. A final chapter focuses on the impact of the environmental justice movement in agency rulemaking. I examine the discursive effects of environmental justice claims both qualitatively and quantitatively. I write about the role of Native activists and environmental groups in shaping federal environmental regulations. Looking across over 20,000 draft regulations that failed to address environmental justice issues, I find that agencies are more likely to add language addressing environmental justice in their final rules when public comments raise environmental justice concerns. However, I have yet to find evidence that mass comment campaigns make this more likely.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"09937f1d16f8685c9b25fee6e7a1ede2","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/templates/rmd-templates/abstract/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/templates/rmd-templates/abstract/","section":"templates","summary":"Political Information in Bureaucratic Policymaking\nDevin Judge-Lord\nThis dissertation examines the effects of public pressure campaigns on agency rulemaking, a technocratic policy process where “public participation” is usually limited to sophisticated lobbying but occasionally includes millions of people mobilized by public pressure campaigns.

As a fourth-year doctoral candidate, the Fellowship would support the final year of my Ph.D. research and a year of post-doctoral research.\nResearch concept Political scientists have long studied how social movements influence elected officials, but we have much to learn about how activists and public pressure may influence bureaucratic policymaking and the role that tactics like mass-comment campaigns play in movement-building. My dissertation examines how advocacy organizations mobilize supporters to amplify more technical lobbying efforts. I focus on agency rulemaking, where most U.S. law is now made, and where organizations like UCS often mobilize thousands of people to engage. To the extent that this tactic aims to influence policy, it presumes that policymakers are more likely to respond to demands amplified by mass mobilization campaigns. While plausible that mass engagement may affect agency decisions both directly, by realizing latent public demands, and indirectly, by influencing elected officials whose opinions matter to agency policymakers, these hypotheses remain untested. We know very little about the conditions under which mass mobilization aimed at bureaucratic policymaking succeeds and the mechanisms by which it may affect policy.\nMy research begins to fill this gap. I develop systematic measures of public engagement in rulemaking over time using text reuse and Bayesian classifiers to link millions of public comments to the advocacy efforts they support. I then use my new measures of public engagement to assess the effects of mobilization on policy by linking changes in policy texts and the policymaking process to the demands of each coalition. For example, in preliminary work for a chapter on the influence of environmental justice (EJ) activists in rulemaking, I compare the preambles of draft and final rules and analyze the comments submitted on each rule. I identify 21,544 draft agency rules that plausibly affect EJ issues but do not mention “environmental justice.’’ In comments submitted on 1,496 of these draft rules, commenters raised “environmental justice” as a concern. When they did, agencies were more likely to add EJ language when publishing the final rule. This suggests that advocacy efforts may indeed influence rulemaking. While I have yet to find an effect for the volume of public comments, I am developing more sophisticated methods to better test the hypothesis that agencies are more likely to respond to demands amplified by mass mobilization campaigns.\nA second part of my dissertation explores how and when Members of Congress are mobilized to engage in agency decisions. Here, I collaborate with Eleanor Powell and Justin Grimmer, leading scholars on legislator behavior. Through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests, we created a new dataset of hundreds of thousands of letters, emails, and phone calls from legislators to bureaucrats. I use this dataset to identify how advocacy campaigns mobilize or “scare off’” legislator engagement in agency decisions.\nThe Kendall Fellowship would also allow me to advance a third key part of this research agenda: assessing how different tactics mobilize individuals and elected officials and ultimately affect policy. Specifically, I hope to collaborate with organizations like UCS in two ways. First, I hope to integrate data on responses to public engagement campaigns, such as click-through rates for action alerts, data on those engaged, and any personalized text they added. I see these as key to measuring the intensity of public demands and the potential for movements to spread. Second, I hope to help design small randomly-assigned variations in future mobilization efforts—for example, messaging with and without an EJ frame—and use the methods I developed in my dissertation to track legislator and agency responses. Eventually, I hope to collect sufficient experimental evidence to causally identify effects of public engagement on policy, but the results of even a few experimental manipulations may reveal mechanisms of influence.\nExperience I hold master’s degrees in Environmental Science and Political Science and have significant research and policy experience beyond academia.\nFrom 2009 to 2011, I developed and led a collaborative initiative for Willamette Partnership, a watershed-based nonprofit. This involved convening groups of experts, advocates, and policymakers to draft agency guidance and state law around Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act regulations and Farm Bill Conservation Title criteria. I also helped develop strategic plans for Willamette Partnership, and for the Oregon Sierra Club in my role as Vice Chair of the Columbia Chapter, and I would be excited to help plan the Center for Science and Democracy’s future efforts to empower the scientific community and our supporters.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, I worked for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, analyzing changes in forestry laws. This research emerged from my M.E.Sc. work, where I wrote a book chapter tracing the effects of U.S. NGOs and indigenous activists on forestry laws and a journal article on the evolution of initiatives like the Forest Stewardship Council.\nSince 2015, I have been working on my Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin where I currently teach a class on statistical computing for Ph.D. students. I also hold positions in the Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences and the American Political Science Association’s Science, Technology, and Environmental Politics section.\nAs an organization that mobilizes supporters to amplify science and realize latent public demands, UCS, and the Center for Science and Democracy offer an ideal environment to advance my research.\nThank you so much for your consideration,\nDevin Judge-Lord\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b44e40bff843759f4d95115932da074e","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/templates/rmd-templates/djl-letter/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/templates/rmd-templates/djl-letter/","section":"templates","summary":"To whom it may concern:\nI write to apply for the Kendall Fellowship in Understanding Scientist Activism and Movement Building.

Analyzing thousands of letters that legislators sent to the agency over nearly two decades, we find that these letters are filled with specific references to companies that legislators seek to assist or about which the legislator’s constituents have complaints. We explore which legislators seek to influence the agency, on whose behalf legislators advocate, and the kinds of outcomes they attempt to influence. We find that most individual constituent letters oppose proposed energy projects, but most non-constituent letters advocate in favor of named businesses. Finally, we assess whether legislators’ advocacy behavior is related to the campaign contributions they receive from the energy industry. We find that Republicans and those who receive money from the energy sector write to advocate for energy companies, but not their constituents, while Democrats write comparatively more letters in opposition to energy companies. Campaign contributions are much stronger predictors of pro-business advocacy than other kinds of attention to energy issues, such as energy-related constituency service or advocacy against energy projects. For example, a legislator who receives $200,000 from the energy sector is twice as likely to write advocating on behalf of an energy company than a legislator who received no energy-sector money but no more likely to write on behalf of their constituents or in opposition to an energy project.","tags":null,"title":"Legislator Advocacy on Behalf of Constituents and Corporate Donors","type":"research"},{"authors":["Devin Judge-Lord"],"categories":null,"content":"Political movements shape policy agendas, often reframing policy debates in distributive justice terms.

Supporting theories about how institutions affect receptivity to issue frames, agencies with processes for addressing environmental justice are more responsive. The scale of mobilization also matters; when larger coalitions raise environmental justice concerns, policy texts are more likely to change. However, within the movement, elite organizations have more lobbying success. These findings suggest that policymaking is systematically affected by which groups make distributive justice claims, their alignment with institutional biases, and the levels of public pressure they mobilize.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1a9cc261bf2cd37652c1a44881e18e35","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/research/ej/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/ej/","section":"research","summary":"When groups raise distributive justice concerns, final rules more often change to address these concerns.

Systematically reviewing scholarship is especially challenging for researchers who may lack domain expertise, including junior scholars or those exploring new substantive territory. Conversely, senior scholars may rely on longstanding assumptions and social networks that exclude new research. In both cases, ad hoc literature reviews hinder accumulation of knowledge. Scholars are rarely systematic in selecting relevant prior work or then identifying patterns across their sample. To encourage systematic, replicable, and transparent methods for assessing literature, we propose an accessible network-based framework for reviewing scholarship. In our method, we consider a literature as a network of recurring concepts (nodes) and theorized relationships among them (edges). Network statistics and visualization allow researchers to see patterns and offer reproducible characterizations of assertions about the major themes in existing literature. Critically, our approach is systematic and powerful but also low-cost; it requires researchers to enter relationships they observe in prior studies into a simple spreadsheet — a task accessible to new and experienced researchers alike. Our open-source R package enables researchers to leverage powerful network analysis while minimizing software-specific knowledge. We demonstrate this approach by reviewing redistricting literature.","tags":null,"title":"Mapping Literature with Networks: An Application to Redistricting","type":"research"},{"authors":["Devin Judge-Lord"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7f23ffac670c9cdcc8426a5b075da998","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/research/budgets/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/budgets/","section":"research","summary":"This paper introduces a dataset of over 100,000 pages of discussion about how U.S. federal budget line items ought to be used and explores how well a variety of methods commonly used to identify similarity, difference, and influence among texts travel to this new context.  Ultimately, it aims to test theories about the role of the executive branch in influencing the policy agenda for congressional appropriations and the role of Congress in influencing the policy agenda of executive agencies.  This involves two methodological exercises.  First I contrast several approaches to measure similarity and differences in policy texts were we have strong intuitions about their relationships.  For example, we expect presidential transitions to affect the content of the president’s annual budget. Different text analysis methods give us different perspectives on the magnitude and substance of change.  Second, it outlines an approach for estimating the relative influence of texts on a change in a policy document, for example, the influence of the president’s budget on congressional appropriations committee reports and vice versa.","tags":null,"title":"Measuring Change and Influence in Budget Texts","type":"research"},{"authors":["Devin Judge-Lord","Irene Scher","Ben Cashore"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"819e42d793c59b49e7f2fc1d645de596","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/research/boreal/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/boreal/","section":"research","summary":"We assess the role of US NGOs in shaping Canadian boreal forest policy.","tags":null,"title":"Non-domestic Sources of Canadian Boreal Forest Policy","type":"research"},{"authors":["Rochelle Snyder","Devin Judge-Lord","Justin Grimmer","Eleanor Neff Powell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"89d8a9c86860178781724a530b95a4dc","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/research/correp/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/correp/","section":"research","summary":"We leverage a massive new comprehensive database of constituent service requests from Members of Congress to examine which types of constituents receive help from Members of Congress and how electing a Republican or Democrat affects who gets served. We find that the amount of help that legislators provide veterans and seniors aligns with the number of veterans and seniors in their district. However, the share of low-income constituents does not predict the amount of help that legislators provide to constituents seeking help during hardship. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that Republicans provide less constituency service than Democrats overall. We fail to detect partisan differences in the amount of service to businesses, veterans, or seniors, but we find that Republicans provide much less service to low-income individuals. We offer potential explanations for this disparity, including demand from constituents and elected officials' willingness to supply it.  Our results show that elections have consequences for the provision of service to constituents.

Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups. Yet agencies occasionally receive thousands, even millions, of comments from ordinary people. How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass participation into models of bureaucratic policymaking? Are public pressure campaigns, like other lobbying tactics, primarily used by well-resourced groups to create an impression of public support? Or are they better understood as conflict expansion tactics used by less-resourced groups? To answer these questions, I collect and analyze millions of public comments on draft agency rules. Using text analysis methods underlying plagiarism detection, I match individual public comments to pressure-group campaigns. Contrary to other forms of lobbying, I find that mass comment campaigns are almost always a conflict expansion tactic rather than well-resourced groups creating an impression of public support. Most public comments are mobilized by public interest organizations, not by narrow private interests or astroturf campaigns. However, the resources and capacities required to launch a campaign cause a few larger policy advocacy organizations to dominate. Over 80 percent of public comments were mobilized by just 100 organizations, most of which lobby in the same public interest coalitions. As a result, the public attention that pressure campaigns generate is concentrated on a small portion of policies on which these organizations focus. I also find no evidence of negativity bias in public comments. Instead, most commenters supported draft policies during the Obama administration but opposed those of the Trump administration, reflecting the partisan biases of mobilizing groups.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"46c6cf6e682e93274c9154e5ccea32c1","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/research/whymail/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/whymail/","section":"research","summary":"Scholars of bureaucratic policymaking have focused on the sophisticated lobbying efforts of powerful interest groups.

Why do individuals engage when they seemingly have no new information to offer and no power to influence decisions? Who inspires them and to what end? How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass participation into models of bureaucratic policymaking? I argue that mass mobilizing is an attractive and potentially influential tactic because produces political information about the coalition that mobilized it. I measure the scale and intensity of public support for proposed policies and examine alternative explanations that mass mobilization is (1) a conflict expansion tactic, where coalitions with fewer resources leverage public support, or (2) a more conventional lobbying tactic, where groups with superior resources leverage these resources to create an impression of public support. To link individual comments to the more sophisticated lobbying efforts they support, I use text reuse and clustering methods to identify formal and informal coalitions. I also classify different types of supporters. Using these new measures of political mobilization and engagement in agency rulemaking, I find that, in contrast to conventional insider lobbying, the vast majority of mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking is mobilized by public interest group coalitions.","tags":null,"title":"Why Do Agencies (Sometimes) Get So Much Mail?","type":"research"}]
