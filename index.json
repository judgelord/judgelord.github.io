Pressure campaigns mobilize individuals to pressure executive-branch policymakers, both directly and indirectly by mobilizing members of Congress. Congressional attention tracks overall public attention (which is driven by pressure campaigns). Pressure campaigns are more of a fire alarm or beacon than a warning sign---they attract support but do not seem to deter opposition. Unlike groups and individuals, legislators most often engage when they oppose rules. While this often puts legislators on the same side as corporations, controlling for policy position, legislators are slightly more likely to support public interest coalitions.","tags":null,"title":"Public Pressure and Congressional Oversight","type":"research"},{"authors":["Devin Judge-Lord"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":2021,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":2021,"objectID":"221f0589068df9c296db5c75af8aa298","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/research/cj/","publishdate":"1969-12-31T19:33:41-05:00","relpermalink":"/research/cj/","section":"research","summary":"I examine how social movements affect policymaking by assessing the climate movement's impact on 20 thousand policy documents from 24 U.S. federal agencies. Leveraging a new dataset of 40 million public comments on these policies, I find that when public comments raise climate or climate justice concerns, these concerns are more likely to be addressed in the final rule. Effect sizes vary across agencies, possibly due to the alignment of climate and climate justice issue frames with agency missions. The magnitude of public pressure also matters. When more groups and individuals raise climate and climate justice concerns, policy texts are more likely to change, even when controlling for overall levels of public attention. These findings suggest that public pressure for recognizing both scientific and distributive justice claims systematically affects policymaking. Finally, public comments offer a new lens to assess the rise, institutionalization, and impact of the climate justice movement within the broader climate and environmental justice movements.","tags":null,"title":"The Climate Movement's Impact on Technocratic Policymaking","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"76c302fa0fdb0222edfae10010674227","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/project/correspondence/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/correspondence/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4a204af50592df20da673967b6a656e3","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/project/rulemaking/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rulemaking/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Political Information in Bureaucratic Policymaking\nDevin Judge-Lord\nThis dissertation examines the effects of public pressure campaigns on agency rulemaking, a technocratic policy process where “public participation” is usually limited to sophisticated lobbying but occasionally includes millions of people mobilized by public pressure campaigns. Public comment periods on proposed policies purport to provide democratic accountability. Yet theories of bureaucratic policymaking largely ignore the occasional bursts of civic engagement that generate the vast majority of public comments on proposed rules. To fill this gap, I build and test theories about the role of public pressure in policymaking. I collect and analyze millions of public comments to develop the first systematic measures of civic engagement and influence in bureaucratic policymaking. Four substantive chapters address (1) how and why advocacy groups mobilize ordinary people to engage in rulemaking; (2) how public pressure draws the attention of elected officials; (3) how public pressure impacts policy outcomes; and (4) how the environmental justice movement has used opportunities to participate in rulemaking to affect policy.\nThe first chapter (Why Do Agencies (Sometimes) Get So Much Mail?), addresses who participates in public pressure campaigns and why. Are public pressure campaigns, like other lobbying tactics, primarily used by well-resourced groups to create an impression of public support? Or are they better understood as conflict expansion tactics used by less-resourced groups? To answer these questions, I collect and analyze millions of public comments on draft agency rules. Using text analysis methods underlying plagiarism detection, I match individual public comments to pressure-group campaigns. I find that most public comments are mobilized by a few public interest organizations. Over 80% of the 48 million comments on proposed rules posted to regulations.gov were mobilized by just 100 organizations, 87 of which lobby in coalitions with each other. Contrary to other forms of lobbying, I find that mass comment campaigns are almost always a conflict expansion tactic, rather than well-resourced groups creating an impression of public support. Contrary to other forms of political participation, I find no evidence of negativity bias in public comments. Indeed, from 2005 to 2017, most comments supported proposed rules. This is because public comments tend to support Democratic policies and oppose Republican policies, reflecting the asymmetry in mobilizing groups.\nThe second substantive chapter examines the effect of public pressure campaigns on congressional oversight. I assess whether legislators are more likely to engage in rulemaking when advocacy groups mobilize public pressure. This involves collecting and coding thousands of comments from Members of Congress on proposed rules with and without public pressure campaigns. These data also allow me to assess congressional oversight as a mediator in policy influence, i.e., the extent to which public pressure campaigns affect agency decisionmakers directly or indirectly through their effects on elected officials’ oversight behaviors.\nIn a third chapter, I use a mix of hand-coding and computational text analysis methods to assess whether public pressure campaigns increase lobbying success in agency rulemaking. To measure lobbying success, I develop computational methods to identify lobbying coalitions and estimate lobbying success for all rules posted for comment on regulations.gov. These methods are validated against a random sample of 100 rules with a mass-comment campaign and 100 rules without a mass comment campaign that I hand-code for whether each coalition got the policy outcome they sought. I then assess potential mechanisms by which mass public engagement may affect policy. Each mechanism involves a distinct type of information revealed to decisionmakers. A final chapter focuses on the impact of the environmental justice movement in agency rulemaking. I examine the discursive effects of environmental justice claims both qualitatively and quantitatively. I write about the role of Native activists and environmental groups in shaping federal environmental regulations. Looking across over 20,000 draft regulations that failed to address environmental justice issues, I find that agencies are more likely to add language addressing environmental justice in their final rules when public comments raise environmental justice concerns. However, I have yet to find evidence that mass comment campaigns make this more likely.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"09937f1d16f8685c9b25fee6e7a1ede2","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/templates/rmd-templates/abstract/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/templates/rmd-templates/abstract/","section":"templates","summary":"Political Information in Bureaucratic Policymaking\nDevin Judge-Lord\nThis dissertation examines the effects of public pressure campaigns on agency rulemaking, a technocratic policy process where “public participation” is usually limited to sophisticated lobbying but occasionally includes millions of people mobilized by public pressure campaigns.

As a fourth-year doctoral candidate, the Fellowship would support the final year of my Ph.D. research and a year of post-doctoral research.\nResearch concept Political scientists have long studied how social movements influence elected officials, but we have much to learn about how activists and public pressure may influence bureaucratic policymaking and the role that tactics like mass-comment campaigns play in movement-building. My dissertation examines how advocacy organizations mobilize supporters to amplify more technical lobbying efforts. I focus on agency rulemaking, where most U.S. law is now made, and where organizations like UCS often mobilize thousands of people to engage. To the extent that this tactic aims to influence policy, it presumes that policymakers are more likely to respond to demands amplified by mass mobilization campaigns. While plausible that mass engagement may affect agency decisions both directly, by realizing latent public demands, and indirectly, by influencing elected officials whose opinions matter to agency policymakers, these hypotheses remain untested. We know very little about the conditions under which mass mobilization aimed at bureaucratic policymaking succeeds and the mechanisms by which it may affect policy.\nMy research begins to fill this gap. I develop systematic measures of public engagement in rulemaking over time using text reuse and Bayesian classifiers to link millions of public comments to the advocacy efforts they support. I then use my new measures of public engagement to assess the effects of mobilization on policy by linking changes in policy texts and the policymaking process to the demands of each coalition. For example, in preliminary work for a chapter on the influence of environmental justice (EJ) activists in rulemaking, I compare the preambles of draft and final rules and analyze the comments submitted on each rule. I identify 21,544 draft agency rules that plausibly affect EJ issues but do not mention “environmental justice.’’ In comments submitted on 1,496 of these draft rules, commenters raised “environmental justice” as a concern. When they did, agencies were more likely to add EJ language when publishing the final rule. This suggests that advocacy efforts may indeed influence rulemaking. While I have yet to find an effect for the volume of public comments, I am developing more sophisticated methods to better test the hypothesis that agencies are more likely to respond to demands amplified by mass mobilization campaigns.\nA second part of my dissertation explores how and when Members of Congress are mobilized to engage in agency decisions. Here, I collaborate with Eleanor Powell and Justin Grimmer, leading scholars on legislator behavior. Through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests, we created a new dataset of hundreds of thousands of letters, emails, and phone calls from legislators to bureaucrats. I use this dataset to identify how advocacy campaigns mobilize or “scare off’” legislator engagement in agency decisions.\nThe Kendall Fellowship would also allow me to advance a third key part of this research agenda: assessing how different tactics mobilize individuals and elected officials and ultimately affect policy. Specifically, I hope to collaborate with organizations like UCS in two ways. First, I hope to integrate data on responses to public engagement campaigns, such as click-through rates for action alerts, data on those engaged, and any personalized text they added. I see these as key to measuring the intensity of public demands and the potential for movements to spread. Second, I hope to help design small randomly-assigned variations in future mobilization efforts—for example, messaging with and without an EJ frame—and use the methods I developed in my dissertation to track legislator and agency responses. Eventually, I hope to collect sufficient experimental evidence to causally identify effects of public engagement on policy, but the results of even a few experimental manipulations may reveal mechanisms of influence.\n Experience I hold master’s degrees in Environmental Science and Political Science and have significant research and policy experience beyond academia.\nFrom 2009 to 2011, I developed and led a collaborative initiative for Willamette Partnership, a watershed-based nonprofit. This involved convening groups of experts, advocates, and policymakers to draft agency guidance and state law around Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act regulations and Farm Bill Conservation Title criteria. I also helped develop strategic plans for Willamette Partnership, and for the Oregon Sierra Club in my role as Vice Chair of the Columbia Chapter, and I would be excited to help plan the Center for Science and Democracy’s future efforts to empower the scientific community and our supporters.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, I worked for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, analyzing changes in forestry laws. This research emerged from my M.E.Sc. work, where I wrote a book chapter tracing the effects of U.S. NGOs and indigenous activists on forestry laws and a journal article on the evolution of initiatives like the Forest Stewardship Council.\nSince 2015, I have been working on my Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin where I currently teach a class on statistical computing for Ph.D. students. I also hold positions in the Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences and the American Political Science Association’s Science, Technology, and Environmental Politics section.\nAs an organization that mobilizes supporters to amplify science and realize latent public demands, UCS, and the Center for Science and Democracy offer an ideal environment to advance my research.\nThank you so much for your consideration,\nDevin Judge-Lord\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b44e40bff843759f4d95115932da074e","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/templates/rmd-templates/djl-letter/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/templates/rmd-templates/djl-letter/","section":"templates","summary":"To whom it may concern:\nI write to apply for the Kendall Fellowship in Understanding Scientist Activism and Movement Building.

Same as up-weighting responses to shorter surveys? Reasonable weight bounds: We learn more from a 20-question survey than a 10-question survey, but not as much as two 10-question surveys. Can you test or sample weights in that range? (The results are 100% survey-dependent, but how much do they vary depending on which survey is weighted more heavily within these logical bounds).   3. “into government.” Does this mean that only competitive races matter?\nOr might primaries “work” on unchallenged incumbents through the threat of a challenger?\nMaybe drop or down-weight challengers in non-competitive races because they are more open to oddball candidates that add noise in places where we don’t expect the primary to really “work” anyway.\n  When should primaries not work?

Uncompetitive candidates (✓)  Are a-typical candidates/donors responsible for the higher variance in DIME scores for challengers and open seats?

(Say more about why this is not just a candidate trait.)\n Mediation  \" it is important to demonstrate that it affects candidate positioning above and beyond its intermediate effect on district voting.\"\n A district’s past vote share likely influences candidate positions (and decisions to run). However, it may do so primarily because primaries exist. Thus, 1. If the effect of ideology is 100% mediated, primaries might still “work,” and thus, the total effect may be more relevant. 1. What we really want to block is the portion of the effect of past presidential vote share that is not due to its signal of district ideology (i.e., the mediated effect). The way you calculated the average total effect does this, right?

We explore which legislators seek to influence the agency, on whose behalf legislators advocate, and the kinds of outcomes they attempt to influence. We find that most individual constituent letters oppose proposed energy projects, but most non-constituent letters advocate in favor of named businesses. Finally, we assess whether legislators’ advocacy behavior is related to the campaign contributions they receive from the energy industry. We find that Republicans and those who receive money from the energy sector write to advocate for energy companies, but not their constituents, while Democrats write comparatively more letters in opposition to energy companies. Campaign contributions are much stronger predictors of pro-business advocacy than other kinds of attention to energy issues, such as energy-related constituency service or advocacy against energy projects.

We shape and are shaped by our context. Perceptions and practices of subjectivity and agency are learned. As Unger would say, the content of gender is up for grabs. Unger extends this, arguing that all forms of stability in the social world are mere “frozen politics” (12), “complicated and precarious settlements” (135) that could break loose at any time. Like Foucault, de Beauvoir, and others, Unger believes that we can study and theorize about the genology of institutions, social practices the objective nature of our subjectivity, situations, and potential alternatives. Apparent constants or similarities across institutions are usually the results of them being copied from elsewhere–reproduction and diffusion. There is no human nature (20). No proper order of emotions, virtues, or vices (25). “There are just too many ways to be human” (30). There are no necessary kinds of relations or forms of organization. No natural order or “natural law of human history” and no end (21). All social roles and forms of organization are up for grabs. The aim is to “free ourselves from a social script that both subordinates us unnecessarily to an over-powering scheme of class, communal, gender, and national divisions and denies us as individuals as groups, and as whole societies a greater mastery over the institutional and imaginative contexts of our lives” (8).1\nUnger puts this in more direct conversation with Marx and Lukács, who also see mind and society as an artifact. But, Unger argues, Marx, Lukács, and other deep-structure theorists fell into the trap of necessitarian thinking. By assuming (theorizing?) foundational superstructures and world-historical sequences, they failed to take the society-as-artifact insight all the way. “These theories repeatedly betrayed their understanding of society as an artifact by the fashion in which they turned this understanding into a concrete praxis of social explanation” (228).\n Does de Beauvoir succeed in avoiding this kind of error?\n How is this similar or different from Chakrabarty’s critique of explanatory narratives? Does Unger succeed in avoiding reification?  Plasticity  All that you touch\nYou Change.\nAll that you Change\nChanges you.\nThe only lasting truth\nis Change.\nGod\nis Change.\n- Octavia Butler, Parable of the Sower\n To the extent that formative context has a fundamental feature (we can debate whether it can), Unger would replace “mode of production” with “plasticity” / “negative capability”/ “disentrenchment”/ “denaturalization”/ “emancipation from false necessity”–i.e., openness to change. Two key features of an institutional context are (1) “the degree to which a formative context can be challenged in the midst of ordinary social life…[and (2)] the relative disengagement of our practical and passionated dealings from a preexisting structure of roles and hierarchies” (173). Some institutional structures contain and inhibit change (mainly by limiting the imagination of alternative arrangements). Others build in features that foster their own reimagination and transformation. The upshot of plasticity is that it closes the gap between human longings and circumstances (18).\n Super Theory and Ultra Theory Unger identifies three moves made by deep structure theorists, of whom Marx is the most prominent example.\nThe conceptual difference between formative context and formed routine (see 73 for a good definition)\n A discrete list of possible structures (feudalism, capitalism, communism, etc.)\n Deterministic historical sequences from one deep structure/stage to another\n  Positivist social scientists deny the first (“institutional fetishism”) and implicitly assume versions of the latter two.\nUnger would have us keep the first and abandon the latter two.\nUnger outlines two approaches to do so but only pursues one (86-89). He ironically calls these methods “super theory” and “ultra theory.” Super theory aims to use social science insights to advance a non-positivist theory of society, society as an artifact but one that can be studied and understood in limited, historically contingent ways that nevertheless point towards interventions that could transform it. Ultra theory also takes society as an artifact but rejects the attempt to develop any theoretical system. Ultra theory sounds like Hokenmeir and Adorno, relentless critique to undermine all claims to systematic theory.\nUnger sees ultra theory as a defensible approach but warns against falling into the same trap that positivists fall into in trying to find firm ground for their critique. In my reading, Horkheimer and Adorno seem to avoid this trap. What do you think? Unger’s other concern about skeptical postmodern criticism is that it, like deep-structure theory, may deprive us of constructive insights.\nSuper-theory, conversely, is at risk of falling into the deep-theorists trap of assuming necessary structures of sequences in their effort to explain and make sense of the world. “When we reach toward general explanation, we often lapse back into deep-structure moves” (55). If society is an artifact, if it is all politics, then no conceptual distinction can be foundational, no deep structure can be world-historical, every configuration of institutions is distinct and contingent on a unique history of bargains.\n  Totality and The Way Out By keeping the context-routine distinction and abandoning discrete structures or sequences, Unger splits the totality in two (maybe others have done this, but Unger eschews citations, so it is hard to tell when he is borrowing). We are in a totality in the sense that received presuppositions inevitably influence our thinking. But “capitalism” is not a totality. It is many.2 The way out is not through (or at least not through any particular stages); it is to tinker with institutions in presupposition-undermining ways.3 The way out is by “doing things that cannot be dreamt of in the establish mental or social world rather than by creating the world that could realize all dreams” (19).\n “The power to make society always goes beyond all the societies that exist or that have existed, just as the power to discover the truth about the world cannot keep within the forms of discourse that are its vehicles.” (21)\n Unger seems much more optimistic about our potential as “context revising agents” (227 and elsewhere) than Horkheimer and Adorno. Both are interested in our imaginative potential to create something new, but Unger seems to see it happening in many more places than High Art.\n “Our beliefs about ideals and interests are shaped by the institutional and imaginative frameworks of social life. But they are not shaped completely…We regularly invest our recognized interests and ideals with ill-defined longings that we cannot satisfy within the limits imposed by our current institutional and imaginative assumptions.” (7)\n The Subject’s objective nature is far from fully determined and seems to be highly available to anyone.\n “All our major problems in understanding of society arise from…the difficulty of accounting for the actions of a being who, individually and collectively, in thought and relationship, might break through the contexts within which he ordinarily moves. The truth of human freedom, of our strange freedom from any given finite structure, must count, count affirmatively, for the way we understand ourselves and our history.” (23-24)\n Unger seems aligned with Chakrabarty and others on the need for perspective (to “see the settled from the angle of the unsettled”) but does not give subaltern culture a special role. Perhaps this is because, for Unger, there is no essential “capitalism” and “outside”—only different configurations of institutions.4\nLike Chakrabarty and Adorno, different historical institutional configurations are pools of imaginative resources to be adapted and reconfigured—the raw material of society-making5—“the wealth of materials available for context-transforming use: the surviving residues of past institutional arrangements and imaginative worlds, the stubborn anomalies of a social order” (8).\n Transformation without Revolution Unger emphasizes his commitment to the radical project and transformative change, but one of his argument’s real practical implications is that incrementalism can be transformative; no revolution is required. He downplays the incrementalism, calling it “revolutionary reform,” perhaps to avoid sounding like a reformist liberal tinkerer (which Unger is very sure he is not). Still, the potential for institutions to be changed is the linchpin of organizing strategy. In sharp contrast to Marxist claims about the necessity (strategically, theoretically, historically) of revolution, Unger argues that\n “the normal mode of transformative action is revolutionary reform, defined as the substitutions of any one of the loosely and unevenly connected arrangements and beliefs that go into the making of a formative context. A revolutionary reform changes the institutional and imaginative presuppositions taken for granted in the everyday struggles over the uses and mastery of the resources — of capital, governmental power, technical expertise, or legal and moral justification —that enable the occupants of some social status to set terms to what the occupants of other coastal stations do…Revolution becomes the limiting case of transformative action rather than the sole alternative to the statecraft of stability through tinkering.” (84, see also Chapter 7 starting on 150)\n Conservative tinkering maintains institutions; imaginative tinkering sets things in motion. Unger often uses the example of changing the level of public control over the basic flows of investment decisions.\n “If industrial democracy is interpreted to mean a limited level of worker participation in business decisions, it may be accommodated without major disturbance to the established institutional and imaginative framework. Suppose, however, it is understood to require a shift in the basic form of capital allocation and of control over investment decisions. It will then also shake up the imaginative vision that contrasts an area reserved for democratic principles with a realm governed by voluntary contract and technical hierarchy [in the current institutional context, not necessarily, of course].” (168)\n Another good example of formative context, concretely defined in a realistic reform, is the right of incorporation (94).\nUnger believes that the false idea that revolution is required for transformative change is causing the left to miss opportunities, as do the purity tests of orthodoxy. “Experiments in thought and action were stifled by the fear that they might be viewed as an apostasy…a willful closure to the surprises of politics” (43-44). Furthermore, The unwarranted skepticism of institutional reform also leads to pessimism and demobilizing disillusionment with the practicability and the benefits of alternative forms of organization\" (128). “False consciousness” is less of a problem than the suppression of imagination about alternatives; “assumptions about the possible and the real” that result from conflict being successfully contained and the current order winning a perceived “second-order necessity” (129). Indeed, in Unger’s telling, “false consciousness” rings false. There can be no “true” consciousness if consciousness is truly up for grabs.\nPositivists conflation of context and routine is even less imaginative and thus more dangerous—“their practice has a built-in propensity to take the existing framework of social life for granted and thereby to lend it a semblance of necessity nd authority” (4).\nIn both cases, “superstition then encourages surrender.” (6) Belief in fate, lawlike forces, or an end of history hold back both the radical and liberal projects.\nOne example: why has universal suffrage not led to more redistribution of wealth, income, and power? Liberals think most people are happy enough with the current arrangement. Marxists think the proletariat has a false consciousness. Unger thinks that both are failing imagining alternative social orders that could advance their programs; even when we have the power to redistribute wealth, we are taking inherited systems for granted, perceiving them as more natural/necessary than they are, and thus failing to believing in and thus failing to invent new forms of organization. (126-129)\nWhat counts? I am left wanting clarity on exactly the kinds of change count as transformative. Unger provides many examples and is, of course, constitutionally prohibited from offering a closed list, but if a general social theory is the aim, should we not have more general answers to this kind of question?\n A critic may object that we have explained little until we have established the necessary and sufficient conditions for escalation. But a corollary of one major thesis of this book is that we cannot draw up such a list of necessary and sufficient conditions…Instead of necessary and sufficient conditions, the view presented here recognizes that some circumstances regularly encourage escalation while others discourage it.\"\n My questions/critiques here are less about nailing down the preconditions of change and more about the definition of transformation. Unger sees a dichotomy (of scale? of type? both?) demarcating preservation or change in formative context, even while formative context seems to be constantly changing.\n What if a policy change leads to transformation in one area but surpasses conflict in another (as many policies do)? What is the lower bound for “presuppositions taken for granted”? Is no change too small to be considered revolutionary if it undermines a presupposition?    Potential lines of critique 1. Is Unger’s Marxist a straw man? Are modern Marxists more compatible with his project than he lets on? Unger frames his project as both a fundamental rethinking (13)—a “radical alternative to Marxism” (227)—and a friendly “effort to correct and unify the radical project” (14) that is easily compatible with Marxian thought. How big of a change is required? How important are discrete structures and deterministic stages to modern Marxism/Marxianism?6\nWhy discrete structures and stages might be important\nMost importantly for praxis (and perhaps theory), discrete stages imply a totality that must be totally remade. Unger’s approach allows incrementalism and change from within, while the orthodoxy that Unger seems to correctly describe requires total revolution.\n “Stages” language permeates Marxist praxis. We are told we are in “late-stage” capitalism.7 The solution is the “communist” stage.  Capitalism?\n Why discrete structures and stages might not be so important\n The idea of Communism in one country, communist participation in party politics, and more seem to suggest that Marxists believe that incremental change is possible. Indeed modern communists seem more Ungerian than accelerationists. As Unger says, “hopefully, democrats everywhere follow closely any sign of a social experiment, any place on earth, hoping that it may reveal something about the unexplored opportunities for the advancement of the radical project.” (57) Maybe radials are open to experiments and marginal gains after all?\n Despite all of their bomb-throwing, Hokenmeir and Adorno hint that all is not hopeless; there are marginal ways that artists can still make something new. We are not totally trapped. And to the extent that we are not totally trapped, there seems to be room for Unger’s transformative incrementalism.\n  How would Marx and Lukács respond to Unger?\n 2. Is Unger’s social democrat a straw man? Proponents of social democracy might argue that they have the same goals, and their program is no less aimed at plasticity. Unger accuses social democrats of abandoning framework-transforming commitments. The biggest problem seems to be progressives’ comfort with the technical management of social problems. How big a problem is this? Unger asks, “Is social democracy the best that we can reasonably hope for?” (15) The social democrat might ask, “Is petty bourgeoise democracy the best we can hope for?” Would Unger or social democrats answer “yes” to either question?\n 3. Is Unger vulnerable to his own critiques? Unger acknowledges that his project risks falling into the deep-structure theorists’ trap of asserting general patterns. Unger frequently describes “the” features or differences in society in ways that seem to transcend the particular cases he is discussing–he is building theory after all.\nWhere is the line between inappropriately deep theory and appropriate modeling of observed social facts and relationships? In my mind, theory should generalize beyond the case. Unger’s argument against closed lists is persuasive (every empirical coding scheme I have used includes an “other” category). The particular critique of deterministic stages is also persuasive, but patterns of cause and effect seem essential. At some point, we must say that x tends to lead to y, in theory, recognizing that our theory may be incomplete and our inferences contingent on external validity (the jump from what we observe to a broader claim).\nMore broadly, if everything is politics, this must include everything Unger says about theory. Super-theory and ultra-theory are not a closed list of possible ways out. Does Unger lack humility or imagination, or am I off base?\nIt was refreshingly congruent, if tedious at times, for Unger to narrate history as a contingent and unique “haphazard and hodgepodge process” (135), free from necessary forms and stages. However, every time he made any kind of general claim, I got suspicious. For example, “decentralization” and “the market form of economic order” (96 and elsewhere) and “industrial style” (103) seem to have some real substantive content for Unger. Does Unger fall into the deep-structure theorist’s necessitarian thinking at times? Unger critiques Marxist reification of the market (111-113), argues extensively that property and contract are always compromises8, but I can’t shake my suspicion that the abstract assumptions still lurk between the lines.9 Unger attempts to pre-empt the kind of anxiety:\n “The answer, in a nutshell, has two parts: our concerns are not as unique as our situations, and our situations, in an age of partial emancipation from false necessity, enable us to treat anything proposed or tried out in one place as potentially applicable, with adjustments, everywhere else.” (136)\n Is it satisfying?\n 4. What is left for theory? If Marxians are wrong to model deep structure (“macro foundations”) discreetly, are game theorists similarly wrong to model “micro-foundations” discretely?10\nUnger’s “theory”—his “style of generalizing explanation” (60)—seems to be a little ad hoc. He frames it as a grand constructive project, but in practice, the result is a mix of explanations like “see! it could have gone either way,” “what seems like an essential form is just diffusion,” and “here are some lessons from my re-telling of a particular historical episode.” Maybe this is what a social theory move against general social laws is must be.\nTo use his own words, there is no “unrevisable and self-authenticating” truth; instead, we have understanding and insight. Science can only be a “process of self-correction…objectivity through maximum corrigibility” (27). Unger claims that this does not prejudice the possibility of cumulative insight but supplies us instead with a more modest and realistic version of objectivity—the assurance of not being definitively and completely imprisoned by whatever basic assumptions we happen to have inherited\" (29); the objective nature of our subjectivity.\n “For Peirce, the scientific basis of objectivity in science became the gradual convergence of scientific opinion toward a final opinion…You can say the same, though with less assurance, of Hegel’s idea of absolute insight. For, though we can interpret this idea as completed and unconditional knowledge, we can also read it as an ideal limit, never actually reached. It is the affirmative mirror image of the negative, cumulative practice of context smashing” (29)\n Difficult ground on which to construct social theory!\n  Is Unger a Bayesian Social Scientist? In empirical models, we often say that \\(\\beta\\) represents the average effect of X on Y, all else equal, recognizing that we do not know what all else exists. There is noise. There is error. There is happenstance. But probabilistic relationships, we say, can be uncovered. Is this the kind of theorizing Unger means? It seems on some level incompatible, but, and the same time, Unger consistently uses phrases like “tends to,” “is closely connected with,” and “is more likely to” throughout the book.\nIf Unger aims to draw non-positivist understandings from social science, he may have comrades in the Bayesians who see science as less about uncovering hidden truths and more about updating our understandings. Everything is contingent beliefs and uncertain probabilistic relationships. Bayesian statisticians believe that understanding is a combination of prior beliefs and observation. Do presuppositions present a problem for this kind of reasoning? Unger seems to want us down weight our prior beliefs of what is possible. This is a good strategy for more clearly aligning prediction with observation, but it is not the best way to estimate the possible. Given the arbitrary nature of prior belief, is there room for faith (strong priors) in imagined forms of organization beyond what we see? Should we, in a sense, all else equal, dare to assume that desired worlds are possible when the world we observe tells us little. Is this a reasonable interpretation of what it means to substitute “beliefs that go into the making of a formative context”? Is imagination purely generative, or can we believe in things that we imagine?\n Does Unger’s Critique Apply to Positivist “Natural” Science? If society is just frozen politics, is to what extent does natural science inappropriately freeze the natural world? To what extent can fields like ecology and climatology exist as positivist projects when their variables are increasingly the result of human behavior?\nIs there anything “human” about Unger’s theory? Can we truncate “There are just too many ways to be human” to “There are just too many ways to be” and thus sweep in any being (or at least any being with an imagination and a social context)?\n Context-preserving Preserving Quarrels vs. Context-disturbing Struggles. Unger is clear that there is a categorical distinction between context-preserving and disturbing conflict (72-79). To be sure, it is a knife-edge distinction in practice. One can quickly turn into the other. However, he also uses the language of scale “context-preserving quarrels so rarely grow into context-disturbing struggles” (129). Is there a difference in scale, or would Unger just as well have said “change” into context-disturbing struggles and saved me this confusion? On the one hand, we might say that context-transforming is big, necessarily bigger. On the other hand, the incremental steps to leading in a transformative direction depend not on the size of the step but their cumulative direction. Indeed “the positivist social scientist…cannot recognize the nature and extent of its transformative promise”. Yet, “The subjective sign of escalation is the growing intensity of the fighting” (169)—is this always the case for transformative change?\nDrawing a parallel to more empirical scholarship on policy change, Baumgartner and Jones offer a similar account to Unger, focusing more on the scale of change than the context-routine distinction. Like Unger, they observe that policy changes in fits and starts with periods of stability. They call this pattern Punctuated Equilibrium, arguing that societal interests strike bargains, forming a “policy monopoly” that suppresses conflict and leads to stability until some (usually external) perturbation forces new issue frames to the discourse and groups to strike new bargains. The new ideas and alignments cause new policies.\nThe punctuated equilibrium framework was critiqued and extended by Cashore and Howlett, building on Durant and Diehl, who show that transformative policy change can occur in many deceptively small cumulative moves. Furthermore, what may often appear to be transformative change may be quickly reversed–they call this “faux paradigmatic” change. The latter may clearly result from reactionary moves or incorporationist dialectic. I am most interested in what Unger and we make of the former critique that small cumulative changes can be transformative.\nWe might also bring in other political concepts including “policy drift” and “policy feedback” to Unger’s discussion of “cumulative change” (77) and “policy diffusion” to institutional patterns that appear to be stages but turn out to be “a cut-and-paste job” (125) or “follow-the-leader sequence” (154).\n The Program: Is Unger Simply Not a Communist? I know we try to avoid talking too much about programs, and I’ve probably been too practical already, but we might talk about the relationship between theory and program.\nHow far does it get us to imagine a Marxian social science that lacks a commitment to communism? Is it this? Unger wants to free the definition of the radical project from its assumptions about the possible forms of organization (80). If you don’t assume that the goal of praxis is Communism (or perhaps you do assume it is radical petty-bourgeoise democracy), is Unger basically where you land?11 Does his apparent attachment to petty-bourgeois formations color his analysis, or is it as derivative of as he makes it out to be? I don’t want to spend too long on the practical program, but it may be relevant to discuss how ideas about certain reforms affect theories that justify them. For example, if a group is committed to “a narrow conception of transformative possibilities” and thus “maintains the purity of its radical views at the cost of increasing difficulty in winning or maintaining electoral majorities,” does Unger’s critique still have value? How much of the practical value of this critique depends on being open to alternatives to communism?\nTo back up a step, Unger appears to land on petty-bourgeois strategies for organizing production because of his desire to break down task-defining and task-executing roles. The breaking down of predefined roles is emancipation.12 In addition to advancing freedom, liberation from presupposed roles and hierarchies can unleash productive potential.13 “Plasticity” is a “requirement” that must be “satisfied” (217-223). Decentralization, institutionalized political mobilization, self-organization of civil society, and other practical aims do seem to follow from Unger’s commitment to plasticity as means of emancipation, but he must admit at every turn that they are not the only way. We should be able to imagine others, right? Again, do we buy that the program falls out of the theory?\n Alternative Titles If Unger wanted to be more provocative, what would be the best alternative title for Politics?\n Against Revolution and Tinkering\n Incremental Revolution (but I swear I am not a bloody tinkerer)\n When Marxists and Liberals Agree, Both Are Wrong\n   Minor (?) Clarifications  When Unger says, “unless it does irremediable violence to some demand of personal or collective existence, there must be a remade social world in which it might figure,” this is just a normative preference, not a theoretical or empirical claim that society cannot be remade in ways that do violence, correct?\n Unger uses “backward country” (e.g., 138-139). I expected this to be ironic, but if it was, I did not get the joke.\n    “Those who have been converted to the idea of a transformative vocation cannot easily return to the notion of work as an honorable calling within a fixed scheme of social roles and hierarchies, nor can they remain content with a purely instrumental view of labor as a source of material benefits with which to support themselves and their families” (13). Very millennial.↩︎\n There seems to be both a parallel and contradiction with Kojève here. Like Kojève, a formative context is a large collection of different kinds of presuppositions. However, for Unger, these components hang together accidentally and can be rearranged (though some forms of property organization do seem to be more compatible than others in Unger’s mind). The big difference is that Unger sees no end to history (21); there will always be struggles and changing practical and passionate relations (context revision). As a result, it seems that Unger is unconcerned with differentiation. Is this right?↩︎\n Unger would say “revolutionary reform,” but tinkering is a pretty good word for imaginative and experimental action aimed at transforming institutions, no?↩︎\n Am I right that anyone can do this imaginative work, or did I miss somewhere where Unger talks about how some social stations predispose one to see the difference between context and routine and imagine alternatives?↩︎\n “economic capital, state power, practical knowledge, and accepted moral and social ideals” (34)–but this can’t be the full list, right?!?↩︎\n Unger tries to preempt this critique on 57-60. Does he correctly characterize modern Marxian thought?↩︎\n Is Unger persuasive that “capitalism” is incoherent (46-53)? I found it a more persuasive critique of capitalism as a stage than as a formation. I also found myself thinking about Madison, where most people are not employed by for-profit organizations. Do we live in a capitalist society or not?↩︎\n Contract theory is irrelevant! Except that it occupies conceptual ground on which alternative market orders could be developed (120-121).↩︎\n Of course they do! “truth about the world cannot keep within the forms of discourse that are its vehicles.”↩︎\n Unger’s critique of economists (63-71) implies that it must either abandon normative and descriptive debates and become pure analytic tool-making or pursue a theory like Unger’s—public choice economics is incoherent statecraft.↩︎\n Kojève, for example, also enaged in Marxian thought without a committment to communism, but he was more invested in deep structure and less invested in social science.↩︎\n “The leading role of artisans, skilled workers, and small scale producers and professionals and of the advocates of small-scale and cooperative enterprises in challenging the emergent dominant order of the modern West” (63). Also, see 110 \u0026amp; Chapter 12.↩︎\n For example, see how the productive requirements of war destroy social roles. (184-204).↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f56579c8528f63bb30cf0ff3cb7c4121","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/discuss/unger/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/discuss/unger/","section":"discuss","summary":"## Warning: package \u0026#39;knitr\u0026#39; was built under R version 4.1.1 Download PDF\nFormative Context and False Necessity  Here we are—\nEnergy,\nMass,\nLife,\nShaping life,\nMind,\nShaping Mind,\nGod,\nShaping God,\nConsider—\nWe are born\nNot with purpose,\nBut with potential.\n- Octavia Butler, Parable of the Talents\n de Beauvoir posited that minds (and thus, to a large extent, bodies) are products of socially-defined context.

To examine how increased experience and power affect legislators’ behavior, we assemble a massive new database of over 470,000 Congressional requests to federal agencies between 2007 and 2018 obtained through over 396 FOIA requests, a near census of departments, agencies, and sub-agencies. Leveraging variation within legislator-agency pairs, we find that shifts in both capacity and attention explain legislator behavior. When legislators acquire more clout in Washington—particularly committee chairmanships—powerful legislators provide more constituency service, even as they allocate a larger share of their efforts towards broader policy goals. After their election, new legislators incur start-up costs and provide less service, but this difference erodes after two years. In a series of robustness checks, we show that our findings are not the result of variation in constituent demand, nor is it merely a result of voters more easily recognizing more experienced legislators. Rather than experienced and powerful legislators focusing their efforts in Washington and away from their district, we demonstrate that legislators use their increased resources to provide more constituency service.","tags":null,"title":"Potomac Fever or Constituent Ombudsman?: Testing Theory of Legislative Capacity and Priorities","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  1.

It helped fund protests and lobbied, in part, to set up litigation because they knew they would sue for whatever they did not get through lobbying. “politicization of coal, on the other hand, is shaped by a group of industrial, social and political actors with different objectives” Different objectives than whom? I’m not sure what role CSS plays in your story I would read Stokes (2020) much more carefully. There is a lot in there for this chapter, and it is worth citing her work correctly. Oreskes and Conway’s Merchants of Doubt (2010) may also be worth citing in the climate policy section.

We find that the amount of help that legislators provide veterans and seniors aligns with the number of veterans and seniors in their district. However, the share of low-income constituents does not predict the amount of help that legislators provide to constituents seeking help during hardship. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that Republicans provide less constituency service than Democrats overall. We fail to detect partisan differences in the amount of service to businesses, veterans, or seniors, but we find that Republicans provide much less service to low-income individuals. We offer potential explanations for this disparity, including demand from constituents and elected officials' willingness to supply it.  Our results show that elections have consequences for the provision of service to constituents.

Yet agencies occasionally receive thousands or even millions of comments from ordinary people. Why? Why do individuals engage when they seemingly have no new information to offer and no power to influence decisions? Who inspires them and to what end? How, if at all, should scholars incorporate mass participation into models of bureaucratic policymaking? I argue that mass mobilizing is an attractive and potentially influential tactic because produces political information about the coalition that mobilized it. I measure the scale and intensity of public support for proposed policies and examine alternative explanations that mass mobilization is (1) a conflict expansion tactic, where coalitions with fewer resources leverage public support, or (2) a more conventional lobbying tactic, where groups with superior resources leverage these resources to create an impression of public support. To link individual comments to the more sophisticated lobbying efforts they support, I use text reuse and clustering methods to identify formal and informal coalitions. I also classify different types of supporters. Using these new measures of political mobilization and engagement in agency rulemaking, I find that, in contrast to conventional insider lobbying, the vast majority of mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking is mobilized by public interest group coalitions.","tags":null,"title":"Why Do Agencies (Sometimes) Get So Much Mail?","type":"research"}]
