My dissertation focuses on how civic engagement through public pressure campaigns affects agency rulemaking. I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why, whether they affect congressional oversight, and whether they affect policy. My work employs a range of quantitative and qualitative methods, with contributions mostly in the field of text analysis.\nAgency rulemaking My dissertation examines the effects of public pressure campaigns on agency rulemaking, a technocratic policy process where ‚Äúpublic participation‚Äù is usually limited to sophisticated lobbying but occasionally includes millions of people mobilized by public pressure campaigns. Public comment periods on proposed policies purport to provide democratic accountability. Yet theories of bureaucratic policymaking largely ignore the occasional bursts of civic engagement that generate the vast majority of public comments on proposed rules. To fill this gap, I build and test theories about the role of public pressure in policymaking. I collect and analyze millions of public comments to develop the first systematic measures of civic engagement and influence in bureaucratic policymaking. Four substantive chapters address (1) how and why advocacy groups mobilize ordinary people to engage in rulemaking; (2) how public pressure draws the attention of elected officials; (3) how public pressure impacts policy outcomes; and (4) how the environmental justice movement has used opportunities to participate in rulemaking to affect policy.\nThe first chapter (Why Do Agencies (Sometimes) Get So Much Mail?), addresses who participates in public pressure campaigns and why. Are public pressure campaigns, like other lobbying tactics, primarily used by well-resourced groups to create an impression of public support? Or are they better understood as conflict expansion tactics used by less-resourced groups? To answer these questions, I collect and analyze millions of public comments on draft agency rules. Using text analysis methods underlying plagiarism detection, I match individual public comments to pressure-group campaigns. I find that most public comments are mobilized by a few public interest organizations. Over 80% of the 48 million comments on proposed rules posted to regulations.gov were mobilized by just 100 organizations, 87 of which lobby in coalitions with each other. Contrary to other forms of lobbying, I find that mass comment campaigns are almost always a conflict expansion tactic, rather than well-resourced groups creating an impression of public support. Contrary to other forms of political participation, I find no evidence of negativity bias in public comments. Indeed, from 2005 to 2017, most comments supported proposed rules. This is because public comments tend to support Democratic policies and oppose Republican policies, reflecting the asymmetry in mobilizing groups.\nThe second chapter examines the effect of public pressure campaigns on congressional oversight. I assess whether legislators are more likely to engage in rulemaking when advocacy groups mobilize public pressure. This involves collecting and coding thousands of comments from Members of Congress on proposed rules with and without public pressure campaigns. These data also allow me to assess congressional oversight as a mediator in policy influence, i.e., the extent to which public pressure campaigns affect agency decisionmakers directly or indirectly through their effects on elected officials‚Äô oversight behaviors.\nIn a third chapter, I use a mix of hand-coding and computational text analysis methods to assess whether public pressure campaigns increase lobbying success in agency rulemaking. To measure lobbying success, I develop computational methods to identify lobbying coalitions and estimate lobbying success for all rules posted for comment on regulations.gov. These methods are validated against a random sample of 100 rules with a mass-comment campaign and 100 rules without a mass comment campaign that I hand-code for whether each coalition got the policy outcome they sought. I then assess potential mechanisms by which mass public engagement may affect policy. Each mechanism involves a distinct type of information revealed to decisionmakers. A fourth chapter focuses on the impact of the environmental justice movement in agency rulemaking. I examine the discursive effects of environmental justice claims both qualitatively and quantitatively. I write about the role of Native activists and environmental groups in shaping federal environmental regulations. Looking across over 20,000 draft regulations that failed to address environmental justice issues, I find that agencies are more likely to add language addressing environmental justice in their final rules when public comments raise environmental justice concerns. However, I have yet to find evidence that mass comment campaigns make this more likely.\nFor a separate project on rulemaking, I built another novel dataset using internal rulemaking project status reports, offering the first systematic data on rulemaking activities before the publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the starting point for all previous quantitative studies of timing, duration, and delay in rulemaking). These data allow us to study rulemaking across pre- and post-NPRM stages. Using multi-state duration models, we find that producing draft rules is a dynamic policy process and that the timing of NPRM publication is affected by many of the political variables know to affect the publication of final rules. This project is in collaboration with Susan Webb Yackee.\nI work to make data on agency rulemaking and interest groups lobbying available to scholars. Cleaned datasets including the Unified Agenda, Office of Information of Regulatory Affairs reports, and rules and comments posted to regulations.gov are available on my GitHub. Opportunities and challenges for research using these data and others are described in a forthcoming article in Interest Groups \u0026amp; Advocacy with Dan Carpenter, Brian Libgober, and Steve Rashin.\n  Congressional oversight and representation To uncover the drivers of congressional oversight and representation, I am building a large new dataset on interactions between Members of Congress and other parts of the federal government. Through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act Requests, web scraping, and data wrangling, we have assembled data on half a million letters, emails, and phone calls from Members of Congress to federal agencies. These data yield new insights into legislator behavior. For example, we find that as legislators gain institutional power and experience, they do more policy oversight and constituent service. We also find that legislators who receive campaign contributions from energy companies are more likely to advocate for those companies. This work is in collaboration with Eleanor Neff Powell and Justin Grimmer.\nIn another project on interbranch relations and oversight, I use text analysis to study the agenda-setting power of U.S. federal agency budget proposals and congressional appropriations sub-committee reports (see my PolMeth poster on modeling relationships among texts here). I collect and clean a corpus of texts and develop computational methods to detect influence across political texts that enable novel studies of influence in policymaking. I find that changes in party control substantially affect the text of budget documents, suggesting that the policy effects of budget documents go far beyond the numbers they contain.\n Environmental policy In addition to my dissertation‚Äôs substantive focus on environmental policy, I have two collaborative projects examining the role of private actors in regulation through case studies of forestry policy. My article in Organisation \u0026amp; The Environment (‚ÄúDo Private Regulations Ratchet Up?‚Äù) with Ben Cashore and Constance McDermott clarifies debates in the private governance literature by offering methods to measure regulatory stringency. Using these methods, we compare the forest management practices required by the activist-backed Forest Stewardship Council and industry-backed Sustainable Forestry Initiative. Overall, we find the activist-backed requirements to be increasingly more prescriptive. More importantly, we show how various studies have come to different conclusions by focusing on different dimensions of regulatory stringency.\nAnother project on the role of private actors in shaping policy with Irene Scher and Ben Cashore assesses the role of U.S. advocacy groups in shaping Canada‚Äôs forestry regulations. Tracing the history and policy process leading to the world‚Äôs largest conservation initiative, the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement, we argue that while ‚ÄúBig Green‚Äù NGOs claimed credit, local First Nations groups had laid the necessary groundwork. This work was published as a peer-reviewed book chapter, ‚ÄúNon-domestic Sources of Canadian Boreal Forest Policy.‚Äù\n Future research I expect my dissertation research agenda to expand to include the policy impacts of organized public pressure, including social media campaigns and protests. I will continue to build research collaborations with organizers in environmental justice movements as groups organize for and against policies to address the climate crisis. Methodologically, I aim to improve the methods I developed to measure policy influence in budget texts and rulemaking and adapt them to help identify influence wherever policy texts change.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"af3621b237e4317ad03d42e97126bc3d","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/research/statement/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/statement/","section":"research","summary":"Research Statement I study bureaucratic policymaking, congressional oversight and representation, and environmental policy.

As a fourth-year doctoral candidate, the Fellowship would support the final year of my Ph.D.¬†research and a year of post-doctoral research.\nResearch concept Political scientists have long studied how social movements influence elected officials, but we have much to learn about how activists and public pressure may influence bureaucratic policymaking and the role that tactics like mass-comment campaigns play in movement-building. My dissertation examines how advocacy organizations mobilize supporters to amplify more technical lobbying efforts. I focus on agency rulemaking, where most U.S. law is now made, and where organizations like UCS often mobilize thousands of people to engage. To the extent that this tactic aims to influence policy, it presumes that policymakers are more likely to respond to demands amplified by mass mobilization campaigns. While plausible that mass engagement may affect agency decisions both directly, by realizing latent public demands, and indirectly, by influencing elected officials whose opinions matter to agency policymakers, these hypotheses remain untested. We know very little about the conditions under which mass mobilization aimed at bureaucratic policymaking succeeds and the mechanisms by which it may affect policy.\nMy research begins to fill this gap. I develop systematic measures of public engagement in rulemaking over time using text reuse and Bayesian classifiers to link millions of public comments to the advocacy efforts they support. I then use my new measures of public engagement to assess the effects of mobilization on policy by linking changes in policy texts and the policymaking process to the demands of each coalition. For example, in preliminary work for a chapter on the influence of environmental justice (EJ) activists in rulemaking, I compare the preambles of draft and final rules and analyze the comments submitted on each rule. I identify 21,544 draft agency rules that plausibly affect EJ issues but do not mention ‚Äúenvironmental justice.‚Äô‚Äô In comments submitted on 1,496 of these draft rules, commenters raised ‚Äúenvironmental justice‚Äù as a concern. When they did, agencies were more likely to add EJ language when publishing the final rule. This suggests that advocacy efforts may indeed influence rulemaking. While I have yet to find an effect for the volume of public comments, I am developing more sophisticated methods to better test the hypothesis that agencies are more likely to respond to demands amplified by mass mobilization campaigns.\nA second part of my dissertation explores how and when Members of Congress are mobilized to engage in agency decisions. Here, I collaborate with Eleanor Powell and Justin Grimmer, leading scholars on legislator behavior. Through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests, we created a new dataset of hundreds of thousands of letters, emails, and phone calls from legislators to bureaucrats. I use this dataset to identify how advocacy campaigns mobilize or ‚Äúscare off‚Äô‚Äù legislator engagement in agency decisions.\nThe Kendall Fellowship would also allow me to advance a third key part of this research agenda: assessing how different tactics mobilize individuals and elected officials and ultimately affect policy. Specifically, I hope to collaborate with organizations like UCS in two ways. First, I hope to integrate data on responses to public engagement campaigns, such as click-through rates for action alerts, data on those engaged, and any personalized text they added. I see these as key to measuring the intensity of public demands and the potential for movements to spread. Second, I hope to help design small randomly-assigned variations in future mobilization efforts‚Äîfor example, messaging with and without an EJ frame‚Äîand use the methods I developed in my dissertation to track legislator and agency responses. Eventually, I hope to collect sufficient experimental evidence to causally identify effects of public engagement on policy, but the results of even a few experimental manipulations may reveal mechanisms of influence.\n Experience I hold master‚Äôs degrees in Environmental Science and Political Science and have significant research and policy experience beyond academia.\nFrom 2009 to 2011, I developed and led a collaborative initiative for Willamette Partnership, a watershed-based nonprofit. This involved convening groups of experts, advocates, and policymakers to draft agency guidance and state law around Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act regulations and Farm Bill Conservation Title criteria. I also helped develop strategic plans for Willamette Partnership, and for the Oregon Sierra Club in my role as Vice Chair of the Columbia Chapter, and I would be excited to help plan the Center for Science and Democracy‚Äôs future efforts to empower the scientific community and our supporters.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, I worked for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, analyzing changes in forestry laws. This research emerged from my M.E.Sc. work, where I wrote a book chapter tracing the effects of U.S. NGOs and indigenous activists on forestry laws and a journal article on the evolution of initiatives like the Forest Stewardship Council.\nSince 2015, I have been working on my Ph.D.¬†at the University of Wisconsin where I currently teach a class on statistical computing for Ph.D.¬†students. I also hold positions in the Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences and the American Political Science Association‚Äôs Science, Technology, and Environmental Politics section.\nAs an organization that mobilizes supporters to amplify science and realize latent public demands, UCS, and the Center for Science and Democracy offer an ideal environment to advance my research.\nThank you so much for your consideration,\nDevin Judge-Lord\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b44e40bff843759f4d95115932da074e","permalink":"https://judgelord.github.io/templates/rmd-templates/djl-letter/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/templates/rmd-templates/djl-letter/","section":"templates","summary":"To whom it may concern:\nI write to apply for the Kendall Fellowship in Understanding Scientist Activism and Movement Building.

Robustness checks Am I updating my priors correctly? Thoughts on ontology and causality (possibly nonsense)  ???\nMike has clearly thought about this so carefully that I sincerely doubt that I can offer anything thing that pushes the thinking in any way. My comments are really about framing.\nI see my role here as commenting on what is more or less clear as a reader. The thoughts it triggered in my mind and how well that aligns with how you intend me to be updating my priors.\nI‚Äôll suggest some robustness checks because I know you are into that kind of thing.\nI also just want to reiterate some of the important contributions.\n Summary People blame primaries for - polarization - selecting general-election losers - populism\n‚Äì\nBUT, we have yet to observe the preferences of local partisans.\n‚Äì\nMike estimates ideal points for each districts‚Äô partizans.\n‚Äì\nSo, do primaries work?\n‚Äì\nYES , MGD scores predict candidate DIME scores (even when blocking effects through past voting signals)\n  Theory Primaries work if the 1. local partisan voters‚Äô 1. policy preferences/ideologies 1. are represented in/transmitted into government\nImplication: If primaries work, a district‚Äôs partizans‚Äô preferences should affect - Chapter 4: Who runs (and their positions) - Chapter 5: Who wins\n???\nMike helpfully gives us a clear definition that allows us to contrast theory and findings.\n1. ‚Äúlocal partizan voters‚Äù (the median thereof)  (√ó) citizens (√ó) voters (√ó) district partisanship (?) partizan citizens (‚úì) likely partizan voters (population of the latent concept, \\(\\theta\\)) ‚Äúbottom-up ideological pressure from voters‚Äù (‚úì) partizan identifiers (population generating the data, \\(y\\)) (√ó) informed partizan voters (alternative concept). ‚Äúinformational demands that voters may not meet‚Äù  ‚Äì\nNaming things! ü§î‚Äúdistrict-party publics‚Äù vs ‚Äúdistrict-party groups‚Äù vs ‚Äúpartisan constituency‚Äù ‚Äì\u0026gt; ‚Äúthe ideology of a district‚Äôs partizans‚Äù ü§∑\n 2. ‚Äúpolicy prefrences‚Äù/‚Äúideologies‚Äù How sensitive are these ideal points to survey item inclusion and weighting?\n‚Äì\nPolicy items \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Grey area \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Not policy items  ‚Äì\nYou down-weight repeated observations from an individual ‚úì  Would have no effect if everyone is asked 20 questions, correct? Same as up-weighting responses to shorter surveys? Reasonable weight bounds: We learn more from a 20-question survey than a 10-question survey, but not as much as two 10-question surveys. Can you test or sample weights in that range? (The results are 100% survey-dependent, but how much do they vary depending on which survey is weighted more heavily within these logical bounds).   3. ‚Äúinto government.‚Äù Does this mean that only competitive races matter?\nOr might primaries ‚Äúwork‚Äù on unchallenged incumbents through the threat of a challenger?\nMaybe drop or down-weight challengers in non-competitive races because they are more open to oddball candidates that add noise in places where we don‚Äôt expect the primary to really ‚Äúwork‚Äù anyway.\n  When should primaries not work? Unchallenged candidates (?) Uncompetitive districts (?) Uncompetitive candidates (‚úì)  Are a-typical candidates/donors responsible for the higher variance in DIME scores for challengers and open seats? Are these outliers long-short candidates?\n???\nLots of donors only give to conventional candidates they think can win (esp.¬†incumbents), so the higher correlation here may be more a function of time than your measurement.\n Measurement-DIME Scores (How to frame this chapter)\nDIME ~ Strategic candidate positioning? If not, not so informative regarding the strategic positioning dilemma per se (but this is fine)\nDIME ~ Credible candidate policy commitments? If so, good for testing the core representation hypotheses (do primaries work?)\nDIME ~ Informal party networks? If so, are we recovering the correlation between district ideology and party networks?\nbackground-image: url(mgd-scores.png) background-size: contain\n Measurement-DeCrescenzo Scores I would be interested in Figure 4.1 with uncertainty around your measure.\nThat level of separation! (Much more than DIME scores). Do the party mean estimates have a strong pull or that the battery is fairly partisan? The most conservative local Democrats are way more liberal than the most liberal local Republicans.\nAre cutpoints generally less than 0?\n???\nYou may not want to put this in the paper, but I would be interested in figure 4.1 with uncertainty around your measure‚ÄìI imagine this would show a lot less separation.\nI thought they averaged to 0\n Model The unit of observation is \\(DIME_i\\) (4.4-4.7), but only \\(\\overline{DIME}_g\\) is identified (4.2.1), correct?\n‚Äì\n the variables that could confound the relationship between citizen and candidate ideology could differ dramatically across parties\n Thus separate models (latent space?) by party. ‚úì\n incumbency status appears to be a substantial modifier of the relationship between citizen and candidate ideology\n By this logic, must we estimate incumbents separately? (Say more about why this is not just a candidate trait.)\n Mediation  \" it is important to demonstrate that it affects candidate positioning above and beyond its intermediate effect on district voting.\"\n A district‚Äôs past vote share likely influences candidate positions (and decisions to run). However, it may do so primarily because primaries exist. Thus, 1. If the effect of ideology is 100% mediated, primaries might still ‚Äúwork,‚Äù and thus, the total effect may be more relevant. 1. What we really want to block is the portion of the effect of past presidential vote share that is not due to its signal of district ideology (i.e., the mediated effect). The way you calculated the average total effect does this, right? It is just a matter of emphasis on what is blocked and why.\n ‚Äú\\(z_i\\) currently contains an order-3 polynomial function of candidate i‚Äôs total campaign receipts.‚Äù\n Why?\nIs this an intermediate confound between past presidential vote share and candidate DIME score?\n Background features  ‚Äúwe should be concerned that district features that promote conservative voters also promote conservative candidates.‚Äù\n But the role of background features depends on the candidate selection process. For example, does this mean we want to exclude the effect of the fact that the candidate is a draw from the partisan voter pool? Primaries work if the draw is centered on the mean of this group‚Äìnot more likely to come from the left or right tails. (Approximated by estimating the relationship between \\(\\bar{\\theta}_g\\) and \\(\\overline{DIME}_g\\), because we can‚Äôt scale DIME and MGD scores.) Is this what we mean when we are estimating the mediated effect of district partizans?\nVote choice (vote share) varies, but voters‚Äô policy preferences do not?\n4.3.1 Does this over-estimate the effect of previous vote share on donor patters (DIME scores vary over time as candidates come and go)?\n Interpretation Figure 4.4: Past vote share is only an informative for Dem Challengers. The more Republican the district, the more conservative a Democrat challenger‚Äôs donors are, right?\n Related questions about representation Under what conditions do a district‚Äôs partizans policy preferences diverge from the policy preferences (donation patterns) of candidate slate?\n‚Äì\nMediation Under what conditions do the ideologies of a district‚Äôs partizans not determine their vote choice?\nnot all district partizans vote voters choose candidates for reasons other than policy positions measured on surveys ?  background-image: url(metaphysics.gif) class: center inverse # Metaphysics\n  Ontology \u0026amp; Causality  ‚ÄúIdeology affects responses‚Äù\n  ‚ÄúItems reveal different information about the latent construct.‚Äù\n Latent variable: Brains can be parameterized (true idology exists, is a ‚Äúcause‚Äù, a ‚Äúforce‚Äù)\nvs.\n ‚ÄúData depend on the construct.‚Äù\n  ‚ÄúIRT lets us summarize an individual‚Äôs policy preferences.‚Äù\n Latent construct: We construct ideology from responses (true ideology is responses to an infinite number of questions? )\n???\nI would not normally go down this path, but I figure that you might actually care, have answers for these such obtuse questions that help me make sense of them.\nThe first aligns with how we model things\nThe later alings with how we measure things\nMaybe we can align these, may it is nonsense?\n Clarifications  In a policy choice context, the difficulty parameter is better understood as the ‚Äúcutpoint‚Äù parameter, the midpoint between two policy choices where the respondent is indifferent between the choice of Left or Right on item j.\n This phrasing could track the above and below sentences better to stress thas cutpoints, like difficulty, are features of a item, not a respondent. Perhaps this is as simple as saying the ‚Äúmean respondent is indifferent.‚Äù I would actually introduce the cutpoint language in the educational paragraph above, so you don‚Äôt have to intoduce two things at once here, and so you can just use cutpoint going forward.\nI like ‚Äúmidpoint‚Äù better than ‚Äúcutpoint‚Äù or ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù\n ‚Äúhow much to cut capital gains taxes will have a more conservative cutpoint than a question of whether to cut capital gains taxes at all.‚Äù\n This example is confusing because the response scales also seem to differ. Try ‚Äúwhether to cut capital gains tax by 50% will have a more conservative cutpoint than whether to raise capital gains tax by 50%‚Äù or ‚Äúwhether to cut capital gains tax by 50% will have a more conservative cutpoint than whether to cut capital gains tax by 1%‚Äù\nFigure 2.1 could have shading/color for difficulty and line type for discrimination (solid lines for Œπ = 1)\nInstead of ‚Äúbehave identically,‚Äù you could say ‚Äúbe as difficult/conservative and as discriminating‚Ä¶‚Äù\nI like ‚Äútheir ideal point‚Äù rather than ‚Äúher ideal point‚Äù for the generic person.\n ‚Äústandard Normal utility error from Œµi j above‚Äù\n nbd but I don‚Äôt see any equasion with Œµi j above\nNot important, but given how nice you walk through every other step, you could explain the move from individual to population standard deviation in Equasion 2.8\nMight as well say ‚Äúpartizan voters in a district‚Äù rather than partisan citizens in a district\"\nThe discription of 4.2 uses different notation than the figure.\nFigure 4.4 is pretty, but could be a little clearer if there were boxes around the facets (it takes a second to realize that there are 3 x axes).

Environmental justice concerns focus on the unequal access to healthy environments and protection from harms caused by things like pollution and climate change. The ways in which agencies consider environmental justice highlights how rulemaking has distributive consequences, how the public comment process creates a political community, and how claims raised by activists are addressed. Examining over 20,000 rulemaking processes at agencies known to address environmental justice concerns, I find that when public comments raise environmental justice concerns, these concerns are more likely to be addressed in the final rule. Effects vary across agencies, possibly due to the alignment of environmental justice aims with agency missions. While we cannot infer that agencies addressing environmental justice concerns is caused by the public comments themselves, comments may be a good proxy for mobilization in general. Furthermore, the correlation between mobilization and policy changes is largest and most significant in agencies with missions focused on environmental and distributional policy, i.e. the kinds of agencies we may expect to be most responsive to environmental justice concerns.","tags":null,"title":"Social Movements, Science, Bureaucracy, and Democracy","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  To applaud  interdisciplinary in-depth focus on a policy domain impressive elite interviews (make more of these!) highlights interest groups   Interesting findings  As coal got expensive, lobbyists switched their messaging from ‚Äúcoal is cheap‚Äù to ‚Äúcoal is reliable and secure.‚Äù\n  ‚Äúaffordability was highlighted by interviewees as the most important objective that shapes energy policies.‚Äù But ‚Äúreliability and security‚Ä¶are a dominant focus in politics.‚Äù\n Thus, the coal industry succeeded in influencing national political rhetoric but failed to translate political support into policies needed to maintain profits.

I argue that mass mobilizing is an attractive and potentially influential tactic because produces political information about the coalition that mobilized it. I measure the scale and intensity of public support for proposed policies and examine alternative explanations that mass mobilization is (1) a conflict expansion tactic, where coalitions with fewer resources leverage public support, or (2) a more conventional lobbying tactic, where groups with superior resources leverage these resources to create an impression of public support. To link individual comments to the more sophisticated lobbying efforts they support, I use text reuse and clustering methods to identify formal and informal coalitions. I also classify different types of supporters. Using these new measures of political mobilization and engagement in agency rulemaking, I find that, in contrast to conventional insider lobbying, the vast majority of mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking is mobilized by public interest group coalitions.","tags":null,"title":"Why Do Agencies (Sometimes) Get So Much Mail?","type":"research"}]
