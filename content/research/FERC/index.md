abstract: "We use letters that legislators write to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to study congressional attempts to influence bureaucratic decisions. We build on Arnold (1979)’s insights
into how bureaucrats and legislators anticipate how others will react to their actions. Drawing on
thousands of letters from legislators to the agency sent over nearly two decades, we find that these letters
are filled with specific references to companies that legislators seek to assist or about which the legislator’s
constituents have complaints. We explore which legislators seek to influence the agency, on whose behalf
they make requests, and what outcome they attempt to influence. Finally, we match these letters with
campaign finance records to see whether legislators’ behavior correlates with the campaign contributions
they receive from the energy industry. We find that Republicans and those who receive money from
the energy-sector write relatively more letters on behalf of energy companies, but not on behalf of
constituents, while Democrats write comparatively more letters in opposition to energy companies."
