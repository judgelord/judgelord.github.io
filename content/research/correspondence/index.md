abstract: "Representation in Congress is based, in part, on legislators’ ability to assist their constituents with the federal bureaucracy. Constituency service is central to definitions of representation as well as empirical explanations for phenomena such a the incumbency advantage. And yet, too little is known about when and how elected officials contact the bureaucracy on behalf of their constituents. We assemble a massive new database of over 150,000 Congressional requests to agencies between 2007 and 2017 obtained through over 250 FOIA requests, approaching a census of all contacts with the bureaucracy. We examine when legislators contact agencies, which legislators contact those agencies, and the purpose of the contact, showing that as legislators gain power in Washington they often expand their constituency service work, even as they expand their policy work. This suggests that perceived trade-offs constituents may face between influential and attentive representatives is a false choice. Instead, what matters is picking representatives who efficiently use the resources of their office."
