abstract: "This paper introduces a dataset of over 100,000 pages of discussion about how U.S. federal budget line
items ought to be used and explores how well a variety of methods commonly used to identify similarity,
difference, and influence among texts travel to this new context.  Ultimately, it aims to test theories about
the role of the executive branch in influencing the policy agenda for congressional appropriations and the
role of Congress in influencing the policy agenda of executive agencies.  This involves two methodological
exercises.  First I contrast several approaches to measure similarity and differences in policy texts were we
have strong intuitions about their relationships.  For example, we expect presidential transitions to affect
the content of the president’s annual budget. Different text analysis methods give us different perspectives
on the magnitude and substance of change.  Second, it outlines an approach for estimating the relative
influence of texts on a change in a policy document, for example, the influence of the president’s budget
on congressional appropriations committee reports and vice versa."
