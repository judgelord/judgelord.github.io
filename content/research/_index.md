## Rulemaking

My dissertation examines the effects of mass political engagment on bureaucratic policymaking. I introduce a dataset of millions of public comments on draft regulations in ["Why Do Agencies (Sometimes) Get So Much Mail"](/research/whymail/). A second chapter, ["Social Movements, Science, Bureaucracy, and Democracy"](/research/ej/) focuses on the role of the environmental justice movement in shaping federal regulation through public comments. 

In a paper with Susan Webb Yackee, I examine rulemaking across pre- and post-NPRM stages useing monthly internal project status reports from the Department of Transportation and multi-state duration models.

For this project, I measure sub-agency rule-writing capacity and politicization using [OPM data on federal employees](https://github.com/judgelord/FederalEmployees).

## Congressional advocacy and oversight

With Eleanor Powell and Justin Grimmer, I am studying interactions between members of congress and other parts of the federal government. Through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act Requests, webscraping^[[Tutorial on scraping documents and tables with `rvest` and `purrr`](https://judgelord.github.io/correspondence/functions/DOE_FERC-scraper.html)], and data wrangling, we have assembled a massive new [dataset](https://github.com/judgelord/correspondence) of letters, emails, and phone calls from members of congress to federal agencies. We intoduce this dataset in our paper ["How Legislators Actually Spend Their Time: Constituents, donors, or policy"](/research/correspondence/) and are now linking legislator advocacy and oversight behavior to other data such as [campaign contributions by energy companies](/research/FERC/). 

In another project on oversight, I use text analysis to study the agenda-setting power of U.S. federal agency budget proposals and appropriations sub-committee reports (see my PolMeth poster on modeling relationships among texts [here](/research/budgets/)).

## Forestry regulation

Two projects study the role private actors in regulation through case studies of forestry policy.

["Do Private Regulations `Ratchet Up'"](/research/FSC-SFI/) with Constance McDermott and Ben Cashore clarifies debates in the private governance literature by offering methods to measure regulatory stringency. Using these methods, we compare the forest mangement practices requried by the Forest Stewardship Council and Sustainable Forestry Initiative.

A peer-reviewed book chapter, ["Non-domestic Sources of Canadian Boreal Forest Policy"](/research/boreal/) with Irene Scher and Ben Cashore assesses the role of U.S. NGOs in the Canada's boreal forest policy.
