&lt;div id=&#34;overall&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Overall&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarifies important concepts that have been used very sloppily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answeres a big, elusive question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaches us about stats, as well as primaries
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;propagates measurement uncertainty through model stages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAll ideal point estimates are uncertain, but not many studies confront this uncertainty.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pity.jpeg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;summary-of-comments&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary of comments:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarify terminology and scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Framing (&lt;em&gt;strategic positioning&lt;/em&gt; vs.¬†&lt;em&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt;|DIME as the DV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I understand the measures, model, &amp;amp; results?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robustness checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I updating my priors correctly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thoughts on ontology and causality (possibly nonsense)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike has clearly thought about this so carefully that I sincerely doubt that I can offer anything thing that pushes the thinking in any way.
My comments are really about framing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see my role here as commenting on what is more or less clear as a reader. The thoughts it triggered in my mind and how well that aligns with how you intend me to be updating my priors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll suggest some robustness checks because I know you are into that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also just want to reiterate some of the important contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;summary&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People blame primaries for
- polarization
- selecting general-election losers
- populism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT, we have yet to observe the preferences of local partisans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike estimates ideal points for each districts‚Äô partizans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, do primaries work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;yes&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;YES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, MGD scores predict candidate DIME scores (even when blocking effects through past voting signals)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;theory&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Theory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primaries work if the
1. local partisan voters‚Äô
1. policy preferences/ideologies
1. are represented in/transmitted into government&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implication: If primaries work, a district‚Äôs partizans‚Äô preferences should affect
- Chapter 4: Who runs (and their positions)
- Chapter 5: Who wins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike helpfully gives us a clear definition that allows us to contrast theory and findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;local-partizan-voters-the-median-thereof&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. ‚Äúlocal partizan voters‚Äù (the median thereof)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;√ó&lt;/strong&gt;) citizens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;√ó&lt;/strong&gt;) voters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;√ó&lt;/strong&gt;) district partisanship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;) partizan citizens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(‚úì) likely partizan voters (population of the latent concept, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\theta\)&lt;/span&gt;) ‚Äúbottom-up ideological pressure from voters‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(‚úì) partizan identifiers (population generating the data, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;√ó&lt;/strong&gt;) informed partizan voters (alternative concept). ‚Äúinformational demands that voters may not meet‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naming things!&lt;/strong&gt; ü§î‚Äúdistrict-party publics‚Äù vs ‚Äúdistrict-party groups‚Äù vs ‚Äúpartisan constituency‚Äù ‚Äì&amp;gt; ‚Äúthe ideology of a district‚Äôs partizans‚Äù ü§∑&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;policy-prefrencesideologies&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. ‚Äúpolicy prefrences‚Äù/‚Äúideologies‚Äù&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How sensitive are these ideal points to survey item inclusion and weighting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: upper-alpha&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy items &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Grey area&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Not policy items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: upper-alpha&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You down-weight repeated observations from an individual ‚úì&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would have no effect if everyone is asked 20 questions, correct?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same as up-weighting responses to shorter surveys?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasonable-weight-bounds-we-learn-more-from-a-20-question-survey-than-a-10-question-survey-but-not-as-much-as-two-10-question-surveys.-can-you-test-or-sample-weights-in-that-range&#34;&gt;Reasonable weight bounds: We learn more from a 20-question survey than a 10-question survey, but not as much as two 10-question surveys. Can you test or sample weights in that range?&lt;/h2&gt;
(The results are 100% survey-dependent, but how much do they vary depending on which survey is weighted more heavily within these logical bounds).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;into-government.&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. ‚Äúinto government.‚Äù&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that only &lt;strong&gt;competitive&lt;/strong&gt; races matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or might primaries ‚Äúwork‚Äù on unchallenged incumbents through the threat of a challenger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe drop or down-weight challengers in non-competitive races because they are more open to oddball candidates that add noise in places where we don‚Äôt expect the primary to really ‚Äúwork‚Äù anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;when-should-primaries-not-work&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;When should primaries &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; work?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unchallenged candidates (?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompetitive districts (?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompetitive candidates (‚úì)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are a-typical candidates/donors responsible for the higher variance in DIME scores for challengers and open seats? Are these outliers long-short candidates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of donors only give to conventional candidates they think can win (esp.¬†incumbents), so the higher correlation here may be more a function of time than your measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;measurement-dime-scores&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Measurement-DIME Scores&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(How to frame this chapter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIME ~ Strategic candidate positioning?&lt;/strong&gt;
If not, not so informative regarding the strategic positioning dilemma per se (but this is fine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIME ~ Credible candidate policy commitments?&lt;/strong&gt;
If so, good for testing the core representation hypotheses (&lt;strong&gt;do primaries work?&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIME ~ Informal party networks?&lt;/strong&gt;
If so, are we recovering the correlation between district ideology and party networks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;background-image: url(mgd-scores.png)
background-size: contain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;measurement-decrescenzo-scores&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Measurement-DeCrescenzo Scores&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be interested in Figure 4.1 with uncertainty around your measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That level of separation! (Much more than DIME scores). Do the party mean estimates have a strong pull or that the battery is fairly partisan? The most conservative local Democrats are &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more liberal than the most liberal local Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are cutpoints generally less than 0?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not want to put this in the paper, but I would be interested in figure 4.1 with uncertainty around your measure‚ÄìI imagine this would show a lot less separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought they averaged to 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;model&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit of observation is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(DIME_i\)&lt;/span&gt; (4.4-4.7), but only &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\overline{DIME}_g\)&lt;/span&gt; is identified (4.2.1), correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the variables that could confound the relationship between citizen and candidate ideology could differ dramatically across parties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus separate models (latent space?) by party. ‚úì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;incumbency status appears to be a substantial modifier of the relationship between citizen and candidate ideology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this logic, must we estimate incumbents separately? (Say more about why this is not just a candidate trait.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mediation&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mediation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34; it is important to demonstrate that it affects candidate positioning above and beyond its intermediate effect on district voting.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A district‚Äôs past vote share likely influences candidate positions (and decisions to run). However, it may do so primarily &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; primaries exist. Thus,
1. If the effect of ideology is 100% mediated, primaries might still ‚Äúwork,‚Äù and thus, the total effect may be more relevant.
1. What we really want to block is the portion of the effect of past presidential vote share that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; due to its signal of district ideology (i.e., the mediated effect). The way you calculated the average total effect does this, right? It is just a matter of emphasis on what is blocked and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(z_i\)&lt;/span&gt; currently contains an order-3 polynomial function of candidate i‚Äôs total campaign receipts.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this an intermediate confound between past presidential vote share and candidate DIME score?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;background-features&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Background features&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúwe should be concerned that district features that promote conservative voters also promote conservative candidates.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the role of background features depends on the candidate selection process. For example, does this mean we want to exclude the effect of the fact that the candidate is a draw from the partisan voter pool? Primaries work if the draw is centered on the mean of this group‚Äìnot more likely to come from the left or right tails. (Approximated by estimating the relationship between &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\bar{\theta}_g\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\overline{DIME}_g\)&lt;/span&gt;, because we can‚Äôt scale DIME and MGD scores.) Is this what we mean when we are estimating the mediated effect of district partizans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vote choice (vote share) varies, but voters‚Äô policy preferences do not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.3.1 Does this over-estimate the effect of previous vote share on donor patters (DIME scores vary over time as candidates come and go)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;interpretation&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 4.4: Past vote share is only an informative for Dem Challengers. The more Republican the district, the more conservative a Democrat challenger‚Äôs donors are, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;related-questions-about-representation&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Related questions about representation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what conditions do a district‚Äôs partizans policy preferences diverge from the policy preferences (donation patterns) of candidate slate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mediation-1&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mediation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under what conditions do the ideologies of a district‚Äôs partizans &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; determine their vote choice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not all district partizans vote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;voters choose candidates for reasons other than policy positions measured on surveys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ontology &amp;amp; Causality&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIdeology &lt;em&gt;affects&lt;/em&gt; responses‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúItems &lt;em&gt;reveal&lt;/em&gt; different information about the latent construct.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latent &lt;em&gt;variable&lt;/em&gt;: Brains can be parameterized (true idology exists, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a ‚Äúcause‚Äù, a ‚Äúforce‚Äù)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúData &lt;em&gt;depend on&lt;/em&gt; the construct.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIRT lets us &lt;em&gt;summarize&lt;/em&gt; an individual‚Äôs policy preferences.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latent &lt;em&gt;construct&lt;/em&gt;: We construct ideology from responses (true ideology &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; responses to an infinite number of questions? )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would not normally go down this path, but I figure that you might actually care, have answers for these such obtuse questions that help me make sense of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first aligns with how we model things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The later alings with how we measure things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we can align these, may it is nonsense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;clarifications&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Clarifications&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a policy choice context, the difficulty parameter is better understood as the ‚Äúcutpoint‚Äù parameter, the midpoint between two policy choices where the respondent is indifferent between the choice of Left or Right on item j.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrasing could track the above and below sentences better to stress thas cutpoints, like difficulty, are features of a item, not a respondent. Perhaps this is as simple as saying the ‚Äúmean respondent is indifferent.‚Äù I would actually introduce the cutpoint language in the educational paragraph above, so you don‚Äôt have to intoduce two things at once here, and so you can just use cutpoint going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like ‚Äúmidpoint‚Äù better than ‚Äúcutpoint‚Äù or ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúhow much to cut capital gains taxes will have a more conservative cutpoint than a question of whether to cut capital gains taxes at all.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example is confusing because the response scales also seem to differ. Try ‚Äúwhether to cut capital gains tax by 50% will have a more conservative cutpoint than whether to raise capital gains tax by 50%‚Äù or ‚Äúwhether to cut capital gains tax by 50% will have a more conservative cutpoint than whether to cut capital gains tax by 1%‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2.1 could have shading/color for difficulty and line type for discrimination (solid lines for Œπ = 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of ‚Äúbehave identically,‚Äù you could say ‚Äúbe as difficult/conservative and as discriminating‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like ‚Äútheir ideal point‚Äù rather than ‚Äúher ideal point‚Äù for the generic person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äústandard Normal utility error from Œµi j above‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nbd but I don‚Äôt see any equasion with Œµi j above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not important, but given how nice you walk through every other step, you could explain the move from individual to population standard deviation in Equasion 2.8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might as well say ‚Äúpartizan voters in a district‚Äù rather than partisan citizens in a district&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discription of 4.2 uses different notation than the figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 4.4 is pretty, but could be a little clearer if there were boxes around the facets (it takes a second to realize that there are 3 x axes). Also the 0 line from 4.5 is nice (this might actually be all you need).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;possible-typos&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Possible typos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where groups are define as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;policy ideology with a partisan constituency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the policy ideology of a partisan constituency?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of these relationships vary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That setup violates likely violates the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whereas most Dime scores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figures 4.4 and 4.5, DIME not Dime, meh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;simulation-based statistics they are more stable estimators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All ideal point estimates are uncertainty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The writing is clear, and I agree with all of your premises and conclusions, and why it is important, so my commments focus on a few small tweeks to the methods and framing, and next steps in this broader project. 
- on the observational side, I have what I hope is, given your mastery of images, a very doable suggestion for a more direct hypothesis test, given the nature of your hypotheses. 
- on the experimental side, my suggestions for follow up experiments are likely for the next paper

This paper got me thinking so I have a lot of notes that I will go though quickly and send them to you by email.

&lt;h2&gt;1. Visual topic model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservative media ‚Äì&amp;gt; more image features we might call ‚Äúnight‚Äù (dark, high-contrast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Experimental findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peaceful image ‚Äì&amp;gt; no effect on efficacy or support, but more objection to police violence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protestor violence ‚Äì&amp;gt; less efficacy, less support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police violence ‚Äì&amp;gt; less efficacy, less support?
&lt;!-- Especially surprising because police violence is against people, protestor &#34;violence&#34; focuses on property! --&gt;
‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images &amp;gt; words, except for ‚Äúthe police went too far‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;section&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;characterize &lt;em&gt;gradients&lt;/em&gt; for pixels around those key points &lt;!--(e.g. transitions from light to dark, or Red to Green or Blue)--how many getting lighter, how many getting darker, weighted by magnitude (how much lighter or darker) --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exploring data, testing hypotheses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- I am sure you have recieved a lot of feedback about the method in general, but this paper has some specific and important hypotheses --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äútest the expectation that conservative newspapers are more likely to use nocturnal frames‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simpler Task:&lt;/strong&gt; How to &lt;em&gt;measure&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äúnight‚Äù in images?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggestions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect topic models with different &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;s, pick one with the most ‚Äúnocturnal-looking‚Äù topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the ‚Äúmost nocturnal‚Äù topic or topics in many models, average proportions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover patterns, design more direct tests features of interest (observational or experimental)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e.g.¬†dark and high contrast images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- Given your expertise and the night hypotheses, it may be easy to construct much more direct observational tests. --&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model environmental and mood latent feature structure simultaniously with object features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are image fragments draws from a distribution of ‚Äúnight‚Äù or ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù with a probability that varies by image?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or are image fragments draws from a distribution of &lt;strong&gt;objects&lt;/strong&gt; that vary (in brightness and contrast) depending on whether they are drawn from a ‚Äúnight‚Äù or ‚Äúday‚Äù image?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we model &lt;strong&gt;mood&lt;/strong&gt; variation (in global tint, brightness, contrast) alongside &lt;em&gt;object clusters&lt;/em&gt; (local variation, edges, corners, etc. at key points)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can model night/day variation, we could identify variation in &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; is depicted at night and day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;!-- Boring PSA, easy for you to do, but I suspect you will cosign that if people are using topic models, I&#39;ll want to see the rest of the topics and alterntive models summarized because TOPIC PROPORTIONS are a function of other topic proportions and k ---&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regardless of exploratory or testing use of topic models&lt;/strong&gt;, we all should report in appendicies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all topics for models used (e.g.¬†top words via FREX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;models with different &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topic proportions are conditional on other topics (and thus also &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;PSA.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-else-pops-out&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What else pops out?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can topic models recover anything we might label with the concepts tested experimentally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, can you recover latent dimensions for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;peaceful&lt;/em&gt; vs.¬†&lt;em&gt;violent&lt;/em&gt; features?
- e.g.¬†crowds (‚úì) vs.¬†flames (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;police violence&lt;/em&gt; vs.¬†&lt;em&gt;protestor violence&lt;/em&gt; features?
- e.g.¬†riot gear objects vs.¬†broken glass objects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(perhaps a better task for CNNs or other supervised methods using object libraries)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;next-steps&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Next steps?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of potential mechanisms here. You are clearly thinking about this, but perhaps some of my thoughts about disentangling mechanisms will be useful if you go further down this path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor tweaks to this paper‚Äôs framing could leave the door open for different findings for &lt;strong&gt;reactionary movement&lt;/strong&gt; protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- As you note, protests are not conservative because they aim to disrupt the status quo, but there are reactionary movements, like white power and blue lives matter protests, that aim to resist looming changes or reverse ones that have already occurred. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valence (?) &lt;!-- (could also explain result)--&gt;
- negitivity (discomfort, anxiety, linked with crime)

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;expectations-about-attitudes&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expectations about attitudes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúhigher levels of hierarchy-enhancing attitudes to be less susceptible to visual frames of violence in protests and to overall report negative perceptions‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police violence? (Riot gear, bodies on the ground)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro-hierarchy protest? (Swasticas, blue line flags)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protestor on protestor violence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbolic violence (Guns, flags, symbols)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property damage vs.¬†violence?
- blood, teargas, or ambulance (bodily injury) vs.¬†fire or broken glass (property damage)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other small notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not exactly sure what ‚Äúfairness‚Äù means on page 5. Perhaps that a perception that there is a problem implies that the status quo is unfair?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor typo on page 5 ‚Äúparticipation at in social movements.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On page 10, by ‚Äúinitialized with 12 topics,‚Äù you just mean that you set &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(k=12\)&lt;/span&gt; or do you mean that some algorithm chose &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;, but you initialized it with a prior of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(12\)&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure 3 is labeled ‚ÄúTopics‚Äù‚Äìshould be ‚ÄúNight activity topic,‚Äù right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intro to section 4 starts with a second lit review. This is unconventional, and the paper may be better integrated by combining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On page 24, I would not say that they trust the text more, just that the text undermined a baseline assumption that protestors start violence, whereas the image was more open to interpretation. This is evidence for blame/identity hypotheses over cost-benefit hypothesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;formative-context-and-false-necessity&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Formative Context and False Necessity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are‚Äî&lt;br /&gt;
Energy,&lt;br /&gt;
Mass,&lt;br /&gt;
Life,&lt;br /&gt;
Shaping life,&lt;br /&gt;

Shaping God,&lt;br /&gt;
Consider‚Äî&lt;br /&gt;
We are born&lt;br /&gt;
Not with purpose,&lt;br /&gt;
But with potential.&lt;br /&gt;
- Octavia Butler, Parable of the Talents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;de Beauvoir posited that minds (and thus, to a large extent, bodies) are products of socially-defined context. We shape and are shaped by our context. Perceptions and practices of subjectivity and agency are learned. As Unger would say, the content of gender is up for grabs. Unger extends this, arguing that all forms of stability in the social world are mere ‚Äúfrozen politics‚Äù (12), ‚Äúcomplicated and precarious settlements‚Äù (135) that could break loose at any time. Like Foucault, de Beauvoir, and others, Unger believes that we can study and theorize about the genology of institutions, social practices the objective nature of our subjectivity, situations, and potential alternatives. Apparent constants or similarities across institutions are usually the results of them being copied from elsewhere‚Äìreproduction and diffusion. There is no human nature (20). No proper order of emotions, virtues, or vices (25). ‚ÄúThere are just too many ways to be human‚Äù (30). There are no necessary kinds of relations or forms of organization. No natural order or ‚Äúnatural law of human history‚Äù and no end (21). All social roles and forms of organization are up for grabs. The aim is to ‚Äúfree ourselves from a social script that both subordinates us unnecessarily to an over-powering scheme of class, communal, gender, and national divisions and denies us as individuals as groups, and as whole societies a greater mastery over the institutional and imaginative contexts of our lives‚Äù (8).&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger puts this in more direct conversation with Marx and Luk√°cs, who also see mind and society as an artifact. But, Unger argues, Marx, Luk√°cs, and other deep-structure theorists fell into the trap of necessitarian thinking. By assuming (theorizing?) foundational superstructures and world-historical sequences, they failed to take the society-as-artifact insight all the way. ‚ÄúThese theories repeatedly betrayed their understanding of society as an artifact by the fashion in which they turned this understanding into a concrete praxis of social explanation‚Äù (228).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does de Beauvoir succeed in avoiding this kind of error?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is this similar or different from Chakrabarty‚Äôs critique of explanatory narratives? Does Unger succeed in avoiding reification?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;plasticity&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plasticity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that you touch&lt;br /&gt;
You Change.&lt;br /&gt;
All that you Change&lt;br /&gt;
Changes you.&lt;br /&gt;
The only lasting truth&lt;br /&gt;
is Change.&lt;br /&gt;
God&lt;br /&gt;
is Change.&lt;br /&gt;
- Octavia Butler, Parable of the Sower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that formative context has a fundamental feature (we can debate whether it can), Unger would replace ‚Äúmode of production‚Äù with ‚Äúplasticity‚Äù / ‚Äúnegative capability‚Äù/ ‚Äúdisentrenchment‚Äù/ ‚Äúdenaturalization‚Äù/ ‚Äúemancipation from false necessity‚Äù‚Äìi.e., openness to change. Two key features of an institutional context are (1) ‚Äúthe degree to which a formative context can be challenged in the midst of ordinary social life‚Ä¶[and (2)] the relative disengagement of our practical and passionated dealings from a preexisting structure of roles and hierarchies‚Äù (173). Some institutional structures contain and inhibit change (mainly by limiting the imagination of alternative arrangements). Others build in features that foster their own reimagination and transformation. The upshot of plasticity is that it closes the gap between human longings and circumstances (18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;super-theory-and-ultra-theory&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Super Theory and Ultra Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger identifies three moves made by deep structure theorists, of whom Marx is the most prominent example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conceptual difference between formative context and formed routine (see 73 for a good definition)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A discrete list of possible structures (feudalism, capitalism, communism, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deterministic historical sequences from one deep structure/stage to another&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positivist social scientists deny the first (‚Äúinstitutional fetishism‚Äù) and implicitly assume versions of the latter two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger would have us keep the first and abandon the latter two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger outlines two approaches to do so but only pursues one (86-89). He ironically calls these methods ‚Äúsuper theory‚Äù and ‚Äúultra theory.‚Äù Super theory aims to use social science insights to advance a non-positivist theory of society, society as an artifact but one that can be studied and understood in limited, historically contingent ways that nevertheless point towards interventions that could transform it. Ultra theory also takes society as an artifact but rejects the attempt to develop any theoretical system. Ultra theory sounds like Hokenmeir and Adorno, relentless critique to undermine all claims to systematic theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger sees ultra theory as a defensible approach but warns against falling into the same trap that positivists fall into in trying to find firm ground for their critique. In my reading, Horkheimer and Adorno seem to avoid this trap. What do you think? Unger‚Äôs other concern about skeptical postmodern criticism is that it, like deep-structure theory, may deprive us of constructive insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super-theory, conversely, is at risk of falling into the deep-theorists trap of assuming necessary structures of sequences in their effort to explain and make sense of the world. ‚ÄúWhen we reach toward general explanation, we often lapse back into deep-structure moves‚Äù (55). If society is an artifact, if it is all politics, then no conceptual distinction can be foundational, no deep structure can be world-historical, every configuration of institutions is distinct and contingent on a unique history of bargains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;totality-and-the-way-out&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Totality and The Way Out&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By keeping the context-routine distinction and abandoning discrete structures or sequences, Unger splits the totality in two (maybe others have done this, but Unger eschews citations, so it is hard to tell when he is borrowing). We are in a totality in the sense that received presuppositions inevitably influence our thinking. But ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù is not &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; totality. It is many.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The way out is not through (or at least not through any particular stages); it is to tinker with institutions in presupposition-undermining ways.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The way out is by ‚Äúdoing things that cannot be dreamt of in the establish mental or social world rather than by creating the world that could realize all dreams‚Äù (19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe power to make society always goes beyond all the societies that exist or that have existed, just as the power to discover the truth about the world cannot keep within the forms of discourse that are its vehicles.‚Äù (21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger seems much more optimistic about our potential as ‚Äúcontext revising agents‚Äù (227 and elsewhere) than Horkheimer and Adorno. Both are interested in our imaginative potential to create something new, but Unger seems to see it happening in many more places than High Art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOur beliefs about ideals and interests are shaped by the institutional and imaginative frameworks of social life. But they are not shaped completely‚Ä¶We regularly invest our recognized interests and ideals with ill-defined longings that we cannot satisfy within the limits imposed by our current institutional and imaginative assumptions.‚Äù (7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Subject‚Äôs objective nature is far from fully determined and seems to be highly available to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAll our major problems in understanding of society arise from‚Ä¶the difficulty of accounting for the actions of a being who, individually and collectively, in thought and relationship, might break through the contexts within which he ordinarily moves. The truth of human freedom, of our strange freedom from any given finite structure, must count, count affirmatively, for the way we understand ourselves and our history.‚Äù (23-24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger seems aligned with Chakrabarty and others on the need for perspective (to ‚Äúsee the settled from the angle of the unsettled‚Äù) but does not give subaltern culture a special role. Perhaps this is because, for Unger, there is no essential ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù and ‚Äúoutside‚Äù‚Äîonly different configurations of institutions.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Chakrabarty and Adorno, different historical institutional configurations are pools of imaginative resources to be adapted and reconfigured‚Äîthe raw material of society-making&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‚Äî‚Äúthe wealth of materials available for context-transforming use: the surviving residues of past institutional arrangements and imaginative worlds, the stubborn anomalies of a social order‚Äù (8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;transformation-without-revolution&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Transformation without Revolution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger emphasizes his commitment to the radical project and transformative change, but one of his argument‚Äôs real practical implications is that incrementalism can be transformative; no revolution is required. He downplays the incrementalism, calling it ‚Äúrevolutionary reform,‚Äù perhaps to avoid sounding like a reformist liberal tinkerer (which Unger is very sure he is not). Still, the potential for institutions to be changed is the linchpin of organizing strategy. In sharp contrast to Marxist claims about the necessity (strategically, theoretically, historically) of revolution, Unger argues that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúthe normal mode of transformative action is revolutionary &lt;em&gt;reform&lt;/em&gt;, defined as the substitutions of any one of the loosely and unevenly connected arrangements and beliefs that go into the making of a formative context. A revolutionary reform changes the institutional and imaginative presuppositions taken for granted in the everyday struggles over the uses and mastery of the resources ‚Äî of capital, governmental power, technical expertise, or legal and moral justification ‚Äîthat enable the occupants of some social status to set terms to what the occupants of other coastal stations do‚Ä¶Revolution becomes the limiting case of transformative action rather than the sole alternative to the statecraft of stability through tinkering.‚Äù (84, see also Chapter 7 starting on 150)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservative tinkering maintains institutions; imaginative tinkering sets things in motion. Unger often uses the example of changing the level of public control over the basic flows of investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIf industrial democracy is interpreted to mean a limited level of worker participation in business decisions, it may be accommodated without major disturbance to the established institutional and imaginative framework. Suppose, however, it is understood to require a shift in the basic form of capital allocation and of control over investment decisions. It will then also shake up the imaginative vision that contrasts an area reserved for democratic principles with a realm governed by voluntary contract and technical hierarchy [in the current institutional context, not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt;, of course].‚Äù (168)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good example of formative context, concretely defined in a realistic reform, is the right of incorporation (94).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger believes that the false idea that revolution is required for transformative change is causing the left to miss opportunities, as do the purity tests of orthodoxy. ‚ÄúExperiments in thought and action were stifled by the fear that they might be viewed as an apostasy‚Ä¶a willful closure to the surprises of politics‚Äù (43-44). Furthermore, The unwarranted skepticism of institutional reform also leads to pessimism and demobilizing disillusionment with the practicability and the benefits of alternative forms of organization&#34; (128). ‚ÄúFalse consciousness‚Äù is less of a problem than the suppression of imagination about alternatives; ‚Äúassumptions about the possible and the real‚Äù that result from conflict being successfully contained and the current order winning a perceived ‚Äúsecond-order necessity‚Äù (129). Indeed, in Unger‚Äôs telling, ‚Äúfalse consciousness‚Äù rings false. There can be no ‚Äútrue‚Äù consciousness if consciousness is truly up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positivists conflation of context and routine is even less imaginative and thus more dangerous‚Äî‚Äútheir practice has a built-in propensity to take the existing framework of social life for granted and thereby to lend it a semblance of necessity nd authority‚Äù (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, ‚Äúsuperstition then encourages surrender.‚Äù (6) Belief in fate, lawlike forces, or an end of history hold back both the radical and liberal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example: why has universal suffrage not led to more redistribution of wealth, income, and power? Liberals think most people are happy enough with the current arrangement. Marxists think the proletariat has a false consciousness. Unger thinks that both are failing imagining alternative social orders that could advance their programs; even when we have the power to redistribute wealth, we are taking inherited systems for granted, perceiving them as more natural/necessary than they are, and thus failing to believing in and thus failing to invent new forms of organization. (126-129)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-counts&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What counts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am left wanting clarity on exactly the kinds of change count as transformative. Unger provides many examples and is, of course, constitutionally prohibited from offering a closed list, but if a general social theory is the aim, should we not have more general answers to this kind of question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critic may object that we have explained little until we have established the necessary and sufficient conditions for escalation. But a corollary of one major thesis of this book is that we cannot draw up such a list of necessary and sufficient conditions‚Ä¶Instead of necessary and sufficient conditions, the view presented here recognizes that some circumstances regularly encourage escalation while others discourage it.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My questions/critiques here are less about nailing down the preconditions of change and more about the definition of transformation. Unger sees a dichotomy (of scale? of type? both?) demarcating preservation or change in formative context, even while formative context seems to be constantly changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if a policy change leads to transformation in one area but surpasses conflict in another (as many policies do)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the lower bound for ‚Äúpresuppositions taken for granted‚Äù? Is no change too small to be considered revolutionary if it undermines a presupposition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;potential-lines-of-critique&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Potential lines of critique&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;is-ungers-marxist-a-straw-man&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Is Unger‚Äôs Marxist a straw man?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are modern Marxists more compatible with his project than he lets on? Unger frames his project as both a fundamental rethinking (13)‚Äîa ‚Äúradical alternative to Marxism‚Äù (227)‚Äîand a friendly ‚Äúeffort to correct and unify the radical project‚Äù (14) that is easily compatible with Marxian thought. How big of a change is required? How important are discrete structures and deterministic stages to modern Marxism/Marxianism?&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why discrete structures and stages might be important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly for praxis (and perhaps theory), discrete stages imply a totality that must be totally remade. Unger‚Äôs approach allows incrementalism and change from within, while the orthodoxy that Unger seems to correctly describe requires total revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ÄúStages‚Äù language permeates Marxist praxis. We are told we are in ‚Äúlate-stage‚Äù capitalism.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The solution is the ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;figs/employers.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Capitalism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why discrete structures and stages might not be so important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of Communism in one country, communist participation in party politics, and more seem to suggest that Marxists believe that incremental change is possible. Indeed modern communists seem more Ungerian than accelerationists. As Unger says, ‚Äúhopefully, democrats everywhere follow closely any sign of a social experiment, any place on earth, hoping that it may reveal something about the unexplored opportunities for the advancement of the radical project.‚Äù (57) Maybe radials are open to experiments and marginal gains after all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all of their bomb-throwing, Hokenmeir and Adorno hint that all is not hopeless; there are marginal ways that artists can still make something new. We are not totally trapped. And to the extent that we are not totally trapped, there seems to be room for Unger‚Äôs transformative incrementalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would Marx and Luk√°cs respond to Unger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;is-ungers-social-democrat-a-straw-man&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Is Unger‚Äôs social democrat a straw man?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of social democracy might argue that they have the same goals, and their program is no less aimed at plasticity. Unger accuses social democrats of abandoning framework-transforming commitments. The biggest problem seems to be progressives‚Äô comfort with the technical management of social problems. How big a problem is this? Unger asks, ‚ÄúIs social democracy the best that we can reasonably hope for?‚Äù (15) The social democrat might ask, ‚ÄúIs petty bourgeoise democracy the best we can hope for?‚Äù Would Unger or social democrats answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù to either question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;is-unger-vulnerable-to-his-own-critiques&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Is Unger vulnerable to his own critiques?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger acknowledges that his project risks falling into the deep-structure theorists‚Äô trap of asserting general patterns. Unger frequently describes ‚Äúthe‚Äù features or differences in society in ways that seem to transcend the particular cases he is discussing‚Äìhe is building theory after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the line between inappropriately deep theory and appropriate modeling of observed social facts and relationships? In my mind, theory should generalize beyond the case. Unger‚Äôs argument against closed lists is persuasive (every empirical coding scheme I have used includes an ‚Äúother‚Äù category). The particular critique of deterministic stages is also persuasive, but patterns of cause and effect seem essential. At some point, we must say that x tends to lead to y, in theory, recognizing that our theory may be incomplete and our inferences contingent on external validity (the jump from what we observe to a broader claim).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, if everything is politics, this must include everything Unger says about theory. Super-theory and ultra-theory are not a closed list of possible ways out. Does Unger lack humility or imagination, or am I off base?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was refreshingly congruent, if tedious at times, for Unger to narrate history as a contingent and unique ‚Äúhaphazard and hodgepodge process‚Äù (135), free from necessary forms and stages. However, every time he made any kind of general claim, I got suspicious. For example, ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù and ‚Äúthe market form of economic order‚Äù (96 and elsewhere) and ‚Äúindustrial style‚Äù (103) seem to have some real substantive content for Unger. Does Unger fall into the deep-structure theorist‚Äôs necessitarian thinking at times? Unger critiques Marxist reification of the market (111-113), argues extensively that property and contract are always compromises&lt;a href=&#34;#fn8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref8&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I can‚Äôt shake my suspicion that the abstract assumptions still lurk between the lines.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref9&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Unger attempts to pre-empt the kind of anxiety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe answer, in a nutshell, has two parts: our concerns are not as unique as our situations, and our situations, in an age of partial emancipation from false necessity, enable us to treat anything proposed or tried out in one place as potentially applicable, with adjustments, everywhere else.‚Äù (136)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it satisfying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-left-for-theory&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. What is left for theory?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Marxians are wrong to model deep structure (‚Äúmacro foundations‚Äù) discreetly, are game theorists similarly wrong to model ‚Äúmicro-foundations‚Äù discretely?&lt;a href=&#34;#fn10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref10&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger‚Äôs ‚Äútheory‚Äù‚Äîhis ‚Äústyle of generalizing explanation‚Äù (60)‚Äîseems to be a little ad hoc. He frames it as a grand constructive project, but in practice, the result is a mix of explanations like ‚Äúsee! it could have gone either way,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat seems like an essential form is just diffusion,‚Äù and ‚Äúhere are some lessons from my re-telling of a particular historical episode.‚Äù Maybe this is what a social theory move against general social laws is must be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use his own words, there is no ‚Äúunrevisable and self-authenticating‚Äù truth; instead, we have understanding and insight. Science can only be a ‚Äúprocess of self-correction‚Ä¶objectivity through maximum corrigibility‚Äù (27). Unger claims that this does not prejudice the possibility of cumulative insight but supplies us instead with a more modest and realistic version of objectivity‚Äîthe assurance of not being definitively and completely imprisoned by whatever basic assumptions we happen to have inherited&#34; (29); the objective nature of our subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúFor Peirce, the scientific basis of objectivity in science became the gradual convergence of scientific opinion toward a final opinion‚Ä¶You can say the same, though with less assurance, of Hegel‚Äôs idea of absolute insight. For, though we can interpret this idea as completed and unconditional knowledge, we can also read it as an ideal limit, never actually reached. It is the affirmative mirror image of the negative, cumulative practice of context smashing‚Äù (29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficult ground on which to construct social theory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;is-unger-a-bayesian-social-scientist&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Is Unger a Bayesian Social Scientist?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In empirical models, we often say that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\beta\)&lt;/span&gt; represents the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; effect of X on Y, &lt;em&gt;all else equal&lt;/em&gt;, recognizing that we do not know what all else exists. There is noise. There is error. There is happenstance. But probabilistic relationships, we say, can be uncovered. Is this the kind of theorizing Unger means? It seems on some level incompatible, but, and the same time, Unger consistently uses phrases like ‚Äútends to,‚Äù ‚Äúis closely connected with,‚Äù and ‚Äúis more likely to‚Äù throughout the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Unger aims to draw non-positivist understandings from social science, he may have comrades in the Bayesians who see science as less about uncovering hidden truths and more about updating our understandings. Everything is contingent beliefs and uncertain probabilistic relationships. Bayesian statisticians believe that understanding is a combination of prior beliefs and observation. Do presuppositions present a problem for this kind of reasoning? Unger seems to want us down weight our prior beliefs of what is possible. This is a good strategy for more clearly aligning prediction with observation, but it is not the best way to estimate the possible. Given the arbitrary nature of prior belief, is there room for faith (strong priors) in imagined forms of organization beyond what we see? Should we, in a sense, all else equal, dare to assume that desired worlds are possible when the world we observe tells us little. Is this a reasonable interpretation of what it means to substitute ‚Äúbeliefs that go into the making of a formative context‚Äù? Is imagination purely generative, or can we believe in things that we imagine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;does-ungers-critique-apply-to-positivist-natural-science&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Does Unger‚Äôs Critique Apply to Positivist ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù Science?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If society is just frozen politics, is to what extent does natural science inappropriately freeze the natural world? To what extent can fields like ecology and climatology exist as positivist projects when their variables are increasingly the result of human behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anything ‚Äúhuman‚Äù about Unger‚Äôs theory? Can we truncate ‚ÄúThere are just too many ways to be human‚Äù to ‚ÄúThere are just too many ways to be‚Äù and thus sweep in any being (or at least any being with an imagination and a social context)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;context-preserving-preserving-quarrels-vs.-context-disturbing-struggles.&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Context-preserving Preserving Quarrels vs.¬†Context-disturbing Struggles.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unger is clear that there is a categorical distinction between context-preserving and disturbing conflict (72-79). To be sure, it is a knife-edge distinction in practice. One can quickly turn into the other. However, he also uses the language of scale ‚Äúcontext-preserving quarrels so rarely &lt;em&gt;grow&lt;/em&gt; into context-disturbing struggles‚Äù (129). Is there a difference in scale, or would Unger just as well have said ‚Äúchange‚Äù into context-disturbing struggles and saved me this confusion? On the one hand, we might say that context-transforming is big, necessarily bigger. On the other hand, the incremental steps to leading in a transformative direction depend not on the size of the step but their cumulative direction. Indeed ‚Äúthe positivist social scientist‚Ä¶cannot recognize the nature and extent of its transformative promise‚Äù.
Yet, ‚ÄúThe subjective sign of escalation is the growing intensity of the fighting‚Äù (169)‚Äîis this always the case for transformative change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing a parallel to more empirical scholarship on policy change, Baumgartner and Jones offer a similar account to Unger, focusing more on the scale of change than the context-routine distinction. Like Unger, they observe that policy changes in fits and starts with periods of stability. They call this pattern Punctuated Equilibrium, arguing that societal interests strike bargains, forming a ‚Äúpolicy monopoly‚Äù that suppresses conflict and leads to stability until some (usually external) perturbation forces new issue frames to the discourse and groups to strike new bargains. The new ideas and alignments cause new policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punctuated equilibrium framework was critiqued and extended by &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00266.x&#34;&gt;Cashore and Howlett&lt;/a&gt;, building on &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1017/S0143814X00008114&#34;&gt;Durant and Diehl&lt;/a&gt;, who show that transformative policy change can occur in many deceptively small cumulative moves. Furthermore, what may often appear to be transformative change may be quickly reversed‚Äìthey call this ‚Äúfaux paradigmatic‚Äù change. The latter may clearly result from reactionary moves or incorporationist dialectic. I am most interested in what Unger and we make of the former critique that small cumulative changes can be transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;cashore.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might also bring in other political concepts including ‚Äúpolicy drift‚Äù and ‚Äúpolicy feedback‚Äù to Unger‚Äôs discussion of ‚Äúcumulative change‚Äù (77) and ‚Äúpolicy diffusion‚Äù to institutional patterns that appear to be stages but turn out to be ‚Äúa cut-and-paste job‚Äù (125) or ‚Äúfollow-the-leader sequence‚Äù (154).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-program-is-unger-simply-not-a-communist&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Program: Is Unger Simply Not a Communist?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know we try to avoid talking too much about programs, and I‚Äôve probably been too practical already, but we might talk about the relationship between theory and program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How far does it get us to imagine a Marxian social science that lacks a commitment to communism? Is it this? Unger wants to free the definition of the radical project from its assumptions about the possible forms of organization (80). If you don‚Äôt assume that the goal of praxis is Communism (or perhaps you do assume it is radical petty-bourgeoise democracy), is Unger basically where you land?&lt;a href=&#34;#fn11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref11&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Does his apparent attachment to petty-bourgeois formations color his analysis, or is it as derivative of as he makes it out to be? I don‚Äôt want to spend too long on the practical program, but it may be relevant to discuss how ideas about certain reforms affect theories that justify them. For example, if a group is committed to ‚Äúa narrow conception of transformative possibilities‚Äù and thus ‚Äúmaintains the purity of its radical views at the cost of increasing difficulty in winning or maintaining electoral majorities,‚Äù does Unger‚Äôs critique still have value? How much of the practical value of this critique depends on being open to alternatives to communism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To back up a step, Unger appears to land on petty-bourgeois strategies for organizing production because of his desire to break down task-defining and task-executing roles. The breaking down of predefined roles is emancipation.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref12&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In addition to advancing freedom, liberation from presupposed roles and hierarchies can unleash productive potential.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref13&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‚ÄúPlasticity‚Äù is a ‚Äúrequirement‚Äù that must be ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù (217-223). Decentralization, institutionalized political mobilization, self-organization of civil society, and other practical aims do seem to follow from Unger‚Äôs commitment to plasticity as means of emancipation, but he must admit at every turn that they are not the only way. We should be able to imagine others, right? Again, do we buy that the program falls out of the theory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;alternative-titles&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Alternative Titles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Unger wanted to be more provocative, what would be the best alternative title for &lt;em&gt;Politics&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against Revolution and Tinkering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incremental Revolution (but I swear I am not a bloody tinkerer)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Marxists and Liberals Agree, Both Are Wrong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;minor-clarifications&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Minor (?) Clarifications&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Unger says, ‚Äúunless it does irremediable violence to some demand of personal or collective existence, there must be a remade social world in which it might figure,‚Äù this is just a normative preference, not a theoretical or empirical claim that society cannot be remade in ways that do violence, correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unger uses ‚Äúbackward country‚Äù (e.g., 138-139). I expected this to be ironic, but if it was, I did not get the joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- 
I will try to organize that many questions I gave you into three parts: 
his theorical move, 
his epistomological move, 
and his program. 
I assume will we devote time to them in about order. 

1. Theory first: 
In short what de Beauvoir show to be true about gender -- its all politics -- Unger tells us is true about everything -- &#34;it&#39;s all up for grabs&#34; as he often says. 

The whole base-superstructure thing and stages of development need to go out the window. 

I found that part of it totally convincing, so most of my questions boil down to who would disagree with this and on what grounds? 

I also wonder whether Unger, de Beauvoir fully succeed in avoiding necessisitarian assumptions? It seems like a hard thing to do and while I can&#39;t really put my finger on anything I would not be surprised to see it. 

2. His theory demands an anti-necessitarian, non-foundationalist, non-positivist epistomology. 

What does it mean to understand things without big organizing frameworks or discoverable truths? 

Are there others already doing something like that or is this really new? 

3. Finally, his program is interesting and counterintuitive for a radical used to thinking about the industrial working class

Again, who all would reject this program and on what grounds? If we think people are more likelty to agree with his critique that his programe, where is the disconnect that would give rise to that? 
- Do they disagree with his critique? 
- Is it simply people have different committments than Unger
- Or can we imagine different paths to his end goals of emancipation from social scripts nad more plastic institutions. I am particularly intersted in the social democrats and the subaltern. Is there any reason to beleive that socil democrats, feminists, aboloitionsts and the like don&#39;t advance Unger&#39;s same goals without putting so much stock in petty bourghouis radicalism? 
To bring it back to the beginning, if Chakrabarty and de Beauvoir are not wrong, then perhaps organizing the oppressed is an equally good use of time that accomplishes all the same results as organizing professionals, artizins, and small buiness owners. If so, the program becomes a much less important part of this book. 

But lets start with the critique, 
are you convinced that we should replace &#34;mode of production&#34; with &#34;openess to change&#34; as the most essential feature of formative context? Or perhaps a formative context can&#39;t have essential elements at all? 

--&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThose who have been converted to the idea of a transformative vocation cannot easily return to the notion of work as an honorable calling within a fixed scheme of social roles and hierarchies, nor can they remain content with a purely instrumental view of labor as a source of material benefits with which to support themselves and their families‚Äù (13). Very millennial.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be both a parallel and contradiction with Koj√®ve here. Like Koj√®ve, a formative context is a large collection of different kinds of presuppositions. However, for Unger, these components hang together accidentally and can be rearranged (though some forms of property organization do seem to be more compatible than others in Unger‚Äôs mind). The big difference is that Unger sees no end to history (21); there will always be struggles and changing practical and passionate relations (context revision). As a result, it seems that Unger is unconcerned with differentiation. Is this right?&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unger would say ‚Äúrevolutionary reform,‚Äù but tinkering is a pretty good word for imaginative and experimental action aimed at transforming institutions, no?&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I right that anyone can do this imaginative work, or did I miss somewhere where Unger talks about how some social stations predispose one to see the difference between context and routine and imagine alternatives?&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚Äúeconomic capital, state power, practical knowledge, and accepted moral and social ideals‚Äù (34)‚Äìbut this can‚Äôt be the full list, right?!?&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn6&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unger tries to preempt this critique on 57-60. Does he correctly characterize modern Marxian thought?&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn7&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Unger persuasive that ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù is incoherent (46-53)? I found it a more persuasive critique of capitalism as a stage than as a formation. I also found myself thinking about Madison, where most people are not employed by for-profit organizations. Do we live in a capitalist society or not?&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn8&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contract theory is irrelevant! Except that it occupies conceptual ground on which alternative market orders could be developed (120-121).&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn9&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course they do! ‚Äútruth about the world cannot keep within the forms of discourse that are its vehicles.‚Äù&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn10&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unger‚Äôs critique of economists (63-71) implies that it must either abandon normative and descriptive debates and become pure analytic tool-making or pursue a theory like Unger‚Äôs‚Äîpublic choice economics is incoherent statecraft.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn11&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koj√®ve, for example, also enaged in Marxian thought without a committment to communism, but he was more invested in deep structure and less invested in social science.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn12&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe leading role of artisans, skilled workers, and small scale producers and professionals and of the advocates of small-scale and cooperative enterprises in challenging the emergent dominant order of the modern West‚Äù (63). Also, see 110 &amp;amp; Chapter 12.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn13&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, see how the productive requirements of war destroy social roles. (184-204).&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;murray.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as Andrea Campbel notes, policy failure is empirically neglected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou see, we should utilize natural forces and thus get all of our power. Sunshine is a form of energy, and the winds and the tides are manifestations of energy. Do we use them? Oh no! We burn up wood and coal, as renters burn up the front fence for fuel. We live like squatters, not as if we owned the property.‚Äù ‚Äî Thomas Edison, 1910&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stokes brings important questions from the periphery to the core of political science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúelectricity pricing is a function of both government policy and interest group privilege; it is not a simple function of economics.‚Äù (p.¬†70).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus our energy sources!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúConflict rages in legislatures and public utility commissions ‚Ä¶ Just because a coal plant is uneconomic does not mean it will close; if utilities have debt and equity in that plant, they will work hard to keep it open.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;discussion-questions-1&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discussion Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;explaining-policy-failure&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Explaining policy failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what extent did these new policies fail to create new politics vs.¬†create politics what were bad for them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚Äúdisrupted‚Äù/‚Äúfailure of positive feedback‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or (and?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incumbent advantage to &lt;strong&gt;resist&lt;/strong&gt; policy change and &lt;strong&gt;retrenchment&lt;/strong&gt; through negative feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúthe federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was structured initially and then became amplified through policy feedback processes, to support coal production over other values‚Äù (Bozzi 2013)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarification about the theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about the relationship between several concepts. Maybe the example that shows how they co-occur or are distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, there is positive feedback that empowers the utilities. For example, you noted that Ohio HB6 was able to get through in part because past policies had weakened renewable advocates; this policy would further weaken them, so that seems like positive feedback even while it is also a failure of positive feedback for the renewable policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is a matter of semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-durable-are-energy-sector-networks-alliances-with-the-right-and-left&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. How durable are energy-sector networks‚Äô alliances with the right and left&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political economy shapes party politics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúfossil fuel-dependent utilities and industries worked over several years to erode Republican support for clean energy.‚Äù (p.¬†196)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ideological?] networks also shape the political economy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;many important opponents working to undermine Kansas‚Äôs clean energy laws came from outside the state, brought into the conflict through right-wing interest group networks. (p.¬†150).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libertarian defectors on the right? Industry power among liberals? (beyond Democrats with companies or plants in their district)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;astroturf-and-conflict-expansion&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Astroturf and conflict expansion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúgroups &lt;strong&gt;construct&lt;/strong&gt; public opinion both by working with the public and by creating fake public campaigns through astroturfing.‚Äù (p.¬†46).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúthe public is often a &lt;strong&gt;tool&lt;/strong&gt; that advocates and opponents use to try to influence decision-makers.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúthe public‚Äôs &lt;strong&gt;voice&lt;/strong&gt; can be heard through organizing and activism. Still, in contemporary American policymaking, interest groups‚Äô voices are usually much louder than the public‚Äôs. Increasingly, the public is used as a &lt;strong&gt;tool&lt;/strong&gt; by interest groups in their battles over policy.‚Äù
(p.¬†66).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;astroturf-and-conflict-expansion-1&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Astroturf and conflict expansion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe opponents relied heavily on fake grassroots campaigns‚Äîsometimes called ‚Äúastroturfing‚Äù‚Äîwhile advocates tried to bolster and communicate genuine support from rural and Republican parts of the state. Interest groups on &lt;strong&gt;both sides&lt;/strong&gt; aimed to expand the scope of conflict.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOpponent interest groups can simultaneously deploy all of these &lt;strong&gt;direct and indirect&lt;/strong&gt; strategies. When &lt;strong&gt;better-resourced&lt;/strong&gt; opponents continually attack a policy, policy retrenchment can occur by a thousand cuts. (p.¬†66)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;hertle-fernandez-stokes-vs.-schattschneider&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hertle-Fernandez &amp;amp; Stokes vs.¬†Schattschneider?!?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a question I wrestle with
- how do we tell them apart
- do groups use resources to expand conflict ‚Äì if so, this goes against Shnatsneider!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;ohio-hb-6&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ohio HB 6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe unions got duped, because after they supported the legislation, [FirstEnergy Solutions] said we are going to gut the pensions. So I think the Democrats and the labor unions were duped.‚Äù (Stokes, p.¬†220).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn political systems where organized labor was allied with the largest left-wing party and emissions-intensive businesses were allied with the largest right-wing party, a ‚Äòdouble representation‚Äô of emissions-intensive economic interests resulted. In these cases, parties on both sides of the ideological spectrum had factions representing the interests of carbon-intensive constituencies‚Äù (Mildenberger 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;EPA_protest_kills_jobs.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúseveral unions lobbied in support of the bill, given the existing workforce at the nuclear and coal plants. After a decade of attacks on the clean energy laws, there were few clean energy advocates or jobs in the state to contest these opponents. These Democrats would rather side with the utilities and the unions than nurture a new clean economy, even if it meant subsidies for coal. Just six days after the bill was passed, Governor DeWine signed it into law. Despite claiming that they would maintain the union contracts at their plants, FirstEnergy Solutions filed a scheduled update to the bankruptcy proceedings just 12 hours after the final bill passed. In this update, the utility walked back their commitment to union contracts, including pensions.‚Äù (p.¬†220)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú[The United States‚Äô] institutional terrain advantages political actors with the capacity to work across multiple venues, over extended periods, and in a political environment where coordinated government action is difficult, and strategies of evasion and exit from regulatory constraints are often successful.

&lt;h1&gt;To applaud&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interdisciplinary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-depth focus on a policy domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impressive elite interviews (make more of these!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highlights interest groups&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;interesting-findings&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Interesting findings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As coal got expensive, lobbyists switched their messaging from ‚Äúcoal is cheap‚Äù to ‚Äúcoal is reliable and secure.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúaffordability was highlighted by interviewees as the most important objective that shapes energy &lt;strong&gt;policies&lt;/strong&gt;.‚Äù But ‚Äúreliability and security‚Ä¶are a dominant focus in &lt;strong&gt;politics&lt;/strong&gt;.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;thus-the-coal-industry-succeeded-in-influencing-national-political-rhetoric-but-failed-to-translate-political-support-into-policies-needed-to-maintain-profits.&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thus, the coal industry succeeded in influencing national political rhetoric but failed to translate political support into policies needed to maintain profits.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-new-puzzle&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A new puzzle!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say what I took to be the main argument, and you can tell me if that was your intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-argument-part-1&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The argument, part 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q1a. Why has the coal industry persisted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: It blocks regulation (extending its profitable horizon)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q1b. Why has it declined?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: It is less and less profitable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;The decline of coal in the United States is mainly driven by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inexpensive alternative energy sources and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a regulatory system that prioritizes minimizing electricity cost.&#34;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-argument-part-2&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The argument, part 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;q2.-why-is-coal-so-prominent-in-national-political-debates&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q2. Why is coal so prominent in (national) political debates?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Compared to what?*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 elite interviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But also a good deal of secondary-source review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do they disagree, and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;be-clear-about-your-argument-vs.-your-subjects-rhetoric&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be clear about your argument vs.¬†your subjects‚Äô rhetoric:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúChanges in these competing technologies are more important than policies and the efforts of interest groups.‚Äù (p.¬†2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúunfair wholesale market design in favor of natural gas‚Äù (p.¬†9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúcoal interest groups across the country were mobilized to prevent further state legislation; thus, all mandated RPS were written into law before 2008. Since then, utilities and the coal mining industry have successfully blocked RPS‚Äù (p.¬†11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe abolishment of the Clean Power Plan has no tangible effect on the trajectory of future US carbon emissions‚Äù (p.¬†10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!?!?&lt;/em&gt; Then why such a big fight?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;strong&gt;assumptions&lt;/strong&gt; about technology and the political allocation of resources, regulation, property rights, etc. go into EIA and DOE forecasts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do experts‚Äô assumptions differ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;coal-projections.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What assumptions about domestic political economies of importers yield these forecasts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do US coal companies have the power to affect the volume or source of imports?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they shaping energy/climate policy in potential importing countries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;goals&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did interviewees emphasize different ‚Äúobjectives of energy policy‚Äù? Was there a consensus on their place in the 2x2 (policy vs.¬†rhetoric X local vs.¬†federal)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;affordability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reliability &amp;amp; security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cleanness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;equity? (super interesting if elites didn‚Äôt mention policy debates over ‚Äúfair‚Äù prices, ‚Äúfair‚Äù profits, ‚Äúfair‚Äù access, or environmental justice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Contextual factors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;inexpensive-cleaner-technological-advanced-alternatives&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Inexpensive, cleaner, technological advanced alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;why are alternatives inexpensive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;does ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù matter to this story?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚Äútechnologically advanced‚Äù‚Äìis this why they are cheaper?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;polarized-political-environment&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Polarized political environment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn political systems where organized labor was allied with the largest left-wing party and emissions-intensive businesses were allied with the largest right-wing party, a ‚Äòdouble representation‚Äô of emissions-intensive economic interests resulted. In these cases, parties on both sides of the ideological spectrum had factions representing the interests of carbon-intensive constituencies‚Äù (Mildenberger 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;EPA_protest_kills_jobs.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;polarized-political-environment-1&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Polarized political environment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ‚Äúenvironmental‚Äù issues are polarized, and some are not
- coal is moderately polarized
- conservation ag subsidies are not at all
- ‚Äúclimate‚Äù is polarized (even though coal and agriculture can both be framed as climate policy)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all related but have been parsed differently into coalitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;organized-interest-groups&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Organized interest groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú[The United States‚Äô] institutional terrain advantages political actors with the capacity to work across multiple venues, over extended periods, and in a political environment where coordinated government action is difficult, and strategies of evasion and exit from regulatory constraints are often successful. These capacities are characteristic of organized groups, not individual voters.‚Äù- Hacker, Hertel-Fernandez, Pierson, and Thelen (Forthcoming)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;organized-interest-groups-1&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Organized interest groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúMinimizing the electricity rate for local consumers is the most important regulatory objective for the PUCs.‚Äù Do PUCs have goals, or are they venues of political conflict?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúConflict rages in legislatures and public utility commissions‚Ä¶Just because a coal plant is uneconomic does not mean it will close; if utilities have debt and equity in that plant, they will work hard to keep it open.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúPrivate electric utilities have long held a privileged position in energy policy, controlling state regulate bodies for most of the twentieth century‚Äù (Stokes 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to CPC on October 15th!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring Stokes‚Äô insights into the PUC section, since this is what she is writing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúElectricity market deregulation has also contributed to this objective.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúheavily regulated‚Äù compared to what?
‚Äúderegulated‚Äù natural monopolies =&amp;gt; ‚Äúlower prices and improve services.‚Äù
Deregulation just shifted power from PUCs to RSOs and FERC (and somewhat to companies to charge higher rates)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;So, why did coal die?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;changing-technology-i.e.-the-labor-required-per-kwh&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changing technology? i.e., the labor required per KWH?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;political-economy&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Political economy:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity markets are policy tools used to distribute resources, created and contested through politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So are land use and bankruptcy laws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúthe federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was structured initially and then became amplified through policy feedback processes, to support coal production over other values‚Äù (Bozzi 2013)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What &lt;strong&gt;fights&lt;/strong&gt; between what &lt;strong&gt;groups&lt;/strong&gt; constrained by what &lt;strong&gt;institutions&lt;/strong&gt; kept us burning coal for so long? Why are KWH from coal so cheap and profitable when the costs for so many are so high?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What &lt;strong&gt;fights&lt;/strong&gt; between what &lt;strong&gt;groups&lt;/strong&gt; constrained by what &lt;strong&gt;institutions&lt;/strong&gt; made us stop burning coal? Why, despite the industry‚Äôs incumbency advantage and double representation, is coal no longer profitable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;smaller-issues&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Smaller issues:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;missing citations for facts throughout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organizationally, the sections are fairly disconnected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;page 3, ‚ÄúFrom 2016 to 2019, the annual retired capacity has nearly tripled‚Äù does not appear to be true in Figure 3, where the net change was greatest in 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the old DOE predictions could vary in color or shade to indicate when they were made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fairly uncritical about the assumptions in the EIA and other estimates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not clear why table one is formatted the way it is. Are the actors aligned with the objectives? If so, maybe split out the contextual factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ÄúThe US government has been devoted to lower energy prices and has branded cheap energy as
one of the competitive advantages for business‚Äù ‚Äì statements like this need citations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ÄúUnder the price pressure from either regulators or market competition, utilities, which consume more than 90% of US coal, would always choose to build the most inexpensive power plants in order to minimize the electricity bill for customers‚Äù‚Äìreally? That is not how companies typically work, especially natural monopolies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarify types of impacts. ‚Äúenvironmental or climate impact‚Äù is not clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don‚Äôt know what you mean ‚Äúenergy policies have become regulatory, and thus the prominence of partisanship on the issue increased over time.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statements like ‚ÄúIn the past 13 elections cycles, the coal mining industry has been the biggest source of campaign dollars within the mining industry, with 88% of those going to Republican candidates‚Äù need citations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BOX 1. The coal industry did participate in the rule-making process. It helped fund protests and lobbied, in part, to set up litigation because they knew they would sue for whatever they did not get through lobbying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚Äúpoliticization of coal, on the other hand, is shaped by a group of industrial, social and political actors with different objectives‚Äù Different objectives than whom?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm not sure what role CSS plays in your story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would read Stokes (2020) much more carefully. There is a lot in there for this chapter, and it is worth citing her work correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oreskes and Conway‚Äôs Merchants of Doubt (2010) may also be worth citing in the climate policy section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
