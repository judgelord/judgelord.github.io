<p>“coal interest groups across the country were mobilized to prevent further state legislation; thus, all mandated RPS were written into law before 2008. Since then, utilities and the coal mining industry have successfully blocked RPS” (p. 11)</p>

<h2>2. Polarized political environment?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“In political systems where organized labor was allied with the largest left-wing party and emissions-intensive businesses were allied with the largest right-wing party, a ‘double representation’ of emissions-intensive economic interests resulted. In these cases, parties on both sides of the ideological spectrum had factions representing the interests of carbon-intensive constituencies” (Mildenberger 2020)</p>

<h2>3. Organized interest groups</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“[The United States’] institutional terrain advantages political actors with the capacity to work across multiple venues, over extended periods, and in a political environment where coordinated government action is difficult, and strategies of evasion and exit from regulatory constraints are often successful. These capacities are characteristic of organized groups, not individual voters.”- Hacker, Hertel-Fernandez, Pierson, and Thelen (Forthcoming)</p>

<div id="organized-interest-groups-1" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Organized interest groups</h2>
<p>“Minimizing the electricity rate for local consumers is the most important regulatory objective for the PUCs.” Do PUCs have goals, or are they venues of political conflict?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Conflict rages in legislatures and public utility commissions…Just because a coal plant is uneconomic does not mean it will close; if utilities have debt and equity in that plant, they will work hard to keep it open.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Private electric utilities have long held a privileged position in energy policy, controlling state regulate bodies for most of the twentieth century” (Stokes 2020)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>–</p>
<p>Come to CPC on October 15th!</p>
<p>???</p>
<p>Bring Stokes’ insights into the PUC section, since this is what she is writing about.</p>
<p>“Electricity market deregulation has also contributed to this objective.”</p>
<p>“heavily regulated” compared to what?
“deregulated” natural monopolies =&gt; “lower prices and improve services.”
Deregulation just shifted power from PUCs to RSOs and FERC (and somewhat to companies to charge higher rates)</p>

<div id="smaller-issues" class="section level1">
<h1>Smaller issues:</h1>
<ul>
<li>missing citations for facts throughout</li>
<li>organizationally, the sections are fairly disconnected</li>
<li>page 3, “From 2016 to 2019, the annual retired capacity has nearly tripled” does not appear to be true in Figure 3, where the net change was greatest in 2016</li>
<li>the old DOE predictions could vary in color or shade to indicate when they were made</li>
<li>fairly uncritical about the assumptions in the EIA and other estimates</li>
<li>Not clear why table one is formatted the way it is. Are the actors aligned with the objectives? If so, maybe split out the contextual factors.</li>
<li>“The US government has been devoted to lower energy prices and has branded cheap energy as
one of the competitive advantages for business” – statements like this need citations</li>
<li>“Under the price pressure from either regulators or market competition, utilities, which consume more than 90% of US coal, would always choose to build the most inexpensive power plants in order to minimize the electricity bill for customers”–really? That is not how companies typically work, especially natural monopolies.</li>
<li>Clarify types of impacts. “environmental or climate impact” is not clear.</li>
<li>I don’t know what you mean “energy policies have become regulatory, and thus the prominence of partisanship on the issue increased over time.”</li>
<li>Statements like “In the past 13 elections cycles, the coal mining industry has been the biggest source of campaign dollars within the mining industry, with 88% of those going to Republican candidates” need citations</li>
<li>BOX 1. The coal industry did participate in the rule-making process. It helped fund protests and lobbied, in part, to set up litigation because they knew they would sue for whatever they did not get through lobbying.</li>
<li>“politicization of coal, on the other hand, is shaped by a group of industrial, social and political actors with different objectives” Different objectives than whom?</li>
<li>I’m not sure what role CSS plays in your story</li>
