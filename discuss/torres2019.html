<h2>Combines cutting-edge tools to discover patterns + experimental evidence about causal effects</h2>
<!--
The writing is clear, and I agree with all of your premises and conclusions, and why it is important, so my commments focus on a few small tweeks to the methods and framing, and next steps in this broader project. 
- on the observational side, I have what I hope is, given your mastery of images, a very doable suggestion for a more direct hypothesis test, given the nature of your hypotheses. 
- on the experimental side, my suggestions for follow up experiments are likely for the next paper

This paper got me thinking so I have a lot of notes that I will go though quickly and send them to you by email.

<hr />
<p>Other small notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not exactly sure what “fairness” means on page 5. Perhaps that a perception that there is a problem implies that the status quo is unfair?</li>
<li>Minor typo on page 5 “participation at in social movements.”</li>
<li>On page 10, by “initialized with 12 topics,” you just mean that you set <span class="math inline">\(k=12\)</span> or do you mean that some algorithm chose <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, but you initialized it with a prior of <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span>?<br />
</li>
<li>Figure 3 is labeled “Topics”–should be “Night activity topic,” right?</li>
<li>The intro to section 4 starts with a second lit review. This is unconventional, and the paper may be better integrated by combining</li>
<li>On page 24, I would not say that they trust the text more, just that the text undermined a baseline assumption that protestors start violence, whereas the image was more open to interpretation. This is evidence for blame/identity hypotheses over cost-benefit hypothesis.</li>
