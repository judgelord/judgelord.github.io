      <description>&lt;p&gt;I study policymaking, interest groups, congressional oversight and representation, and environmental politics. My current book project focuses on how civic engagement through public pressure campaigns affects agency rulemaking, especially climate and environmental justice campaigns. I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why, whether they affect congressional oversight, and whether they affect policy. I also have large collaborative projects investigating legislator behavior and private environmental governance. My work employs a range of quantitative and qualitative methods, with contributions mostly in the field of text analysis. By building open-source datasets and methods to analyze large volumes of political texts, I try to expand the aspects of democracy that are open to systematic study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;public-pressure-and-policymaking&#34;&gt;Public pressure and policymaking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current book project, &lt;em&gt;Public Pressure&lt;/em&gt;, shows how civic engagement through public pressure campaigns affects executive-branch policymaking, with special attention to climate and environmental justice campaigns. I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why, whether they affect congressional oversight, and whether they affect policy. Answering these questions clarifies the role of interest group lobbying, organizing, and mobilizing tactics in democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 90 percent of U.S. law now made by federal agencies, understanding the politics of bureaucratic policymaking is critical to understanding our democracy. Thousands of agency rules published every year present opportunities to study how groups organize to reframe policy debates and shape policy agendas across institutions and over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agency rulemaking is a technocratic policy process in which participation is usually limited to a few policy insiders. Occasionally, however, public pressure campaigns help make agency rules some of our time&amp;rsquo;s most hotly contested policies. Yet, leading theories of bureaucratic policymaking neither explain nor account for these fitful bursts of civic engagement. To remedy this, I develop and tests theory about the roles of individuals, organizations, coalitions, and political movements in bureaucratic policymaking. I show that pressure campaigns build movements, attract policymakers&#39; attention, and systematically counter corporate power by generating information about public demands and the political environment in which policy is made. At the same time, I find that the impact of pressure campaigns is uneven and contingent on the capacity of interest groups to mobilize and of policymakers to process political information. I make four main contributions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I build on scholarship on social movements, interest group behavior, and lobbying to develop a theory explaining why we should expect different lobbying organizations to mobilize ordinary people under different conditions. I argue that pressure campaigns advantage coalitions with broader public support. Thus, the narrow private interests that dominate policymaking should only rarely and reactively expand the scope of conflict. To assess this theory, I analyze millions of public comments on thousands of agency rules to develop the first systematic measures of public engagement in bureaucratic policymaking. I find that &lt;a href=&#34;whymail&#34;&gt;most public comments are mobilized by public interest coalitions&lt;/a&gt;, not by narrow private interests or astroturf campaigns. However, because expanding the scope of conflict requires significant organizational capacity and resources, campaigns are usually dominated by a few large policy advocacy organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, building on theories of political oversight, I theorize that mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking may alert elected officials to political opportunities and risks, thus affecting oversight behaviors. I assess this argument by analyzing correspondence between members of Congress and agency officials on proposed rules with and without mass engagement. I find that public pressure campaigns are correlated with congressional attention and that &lt;a href=&#34;oversight&#34;&gt;coalitions with more active congressional support are more likely to achieve their policy goals&lt;/a&gt; in agency rulemaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I integrate intuitions about outside lobbying and oversight into a broader theory of how public pressure campaigns may affect policy by producing potentially influential political information. I suggest four causal mechanisms by which lobbying may influence policymakers and expand leading formal models of interest group influence in bureaucratic policymaking to account for political information. I then test these models using &lt;a href=&#34;iterative&#34;&gt;an iterative mix of hand-coding and computational text analysis methods&lt;/a&gt; to measure lobbying success for over 40 million commenters. I find evidence that pressure campaigns indirectly affect policy (by mobilizing members of Congress) but little evidence of direct effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, I contribute to a growing literature on the effects of political movements on policy through case studies of campaigns channeling demands of the climate and environmental justice movements. I show that pressure campaigns are more than a lobbying tactic; they are also an institutionalized form of contentious politics over the distribution of governmental power. I examine the framing effects of environmental justice claims. Though they frequently ignore environmental justice concerns, I find that &lt;a href=&#34;ej&#34;&gt;agency officials are more likely to add language addressing environmental justice in their final rules when public comments and pressure campaigns raise environmental justice concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final empirical chapter shows that &lt;a href=&#34;deference&#34;&gt;rules targeted by pressure campaigns were less likely to be struck down by the Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; than rules that received less public attention. This supports the theory that the scale of public attention to policy issues affects judicial decisions because Justices care about public perceptions and the legitimacy of the Court. The book concludes with policy recommendations for increasing the capacity of government institutions in all three branches to process, vet, and learn from what I call &amp;ldquo;political information&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;including public demands expressed through civic engagement and pressure campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;collaborative-projects-on-agency-rulemaking&#34;&gt;Collaborative projects on agency rulemaking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my book project, I have several large collaborative projects on agency rulemaking. In a recent article in &lt;em&gt;Interest Groups and Advocacy&lt;/em&gt;, my coauthors and I outline several broad &lt;a href=&#34;regdata&#34;&gt;research agendas on bureaucratic policymaking and opportunities to tackle them with new data&lt;/a&gt;. With various groups of coauthors, I am pursuing many of these opportunities. For example, one paper leverages a massive new dataset on all organizations that lobbied on financial regulation following the Dodd-Frank Act. Building on recent landmark work documenting inequality in American politics, we show that wealthy organizations are much more likely to participate in and influence agency rulemaking. We then assess mechanisms that explain the relationship between wealth and policy influence, finding that &lt;a href=&#34;finreg&#34;&gt;wealthier organizations are more influential because they engage in more sophisticated lobbying&lt;/a&gt;. Another paper, with Susan Yackee, leverages the first large-scale data on the agenda-setting politics of producing initial draft rules (the starting point for all previous quantitative studies of timing, duration, and delay in rulemaking). These data allow us to study rulemaking across pre- and post-draft rule stages. We find that the effects of presidential transitions on agency policymaking are even larger for rules that have yet to be announced than in the period between draft and final rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;congressional-oversight-and-representation&#34;&gt;Congressional oversight and representation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second active research agenda focuses on legislator interactions with the bureaucracy, from constituency service to policy oversight. Beyond my book chapter on how &lt;a href=&#34;oversight&#34;&gt;pressure campaigns mobilize congressional oversight&lt;/a&gt;, my work on legislator behavior includes several coauthored articles, a collaborative book project, and a massive ongoing data collection effort. Through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act Requests, web scraping, and data wrangling, my coauthors, research assistants, and I have assembled and hand-coded over half a million letters, emails, and phone calls from members of Congress to federal agencies. These new data allow new tests of theories of legislator behavior. For example, in the first peer-reviewed publication from this project, Eleanor Neff Powell, Justin Grimmer, and I show that &lt;a href=&#34;ferc&#34;&gt;legislators who receive more campaign donations from energy companies are more likely to intervene to support those companies in regulatory and permitting issues&lt;/a&gt;. Another paper, currently under review, shows that &lt;a href=&#34;correspondence&#34;&gt;legislators prioritize policy work as they gain experience and institutional power, but, simultaneously, their increased capacity also allows them to maintain absolute levels of constituency service&lt;/a&gt;. Another paper, with Rochelle Snyder, shows that &lt;a href=&#34;correp&#34;&gt;legislators provide constituency service to some groups like seniors and veterans in proportion to populations in their district, but low-income constituencies do not receive proportionate constituency service&lt;/a&gt;. From this vantage point of detailed observation of legislator offices, our book project addresses how Congress is working, who is left behind, who is getting extra attention, and how to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yet another project on interbranch relations and oversight, I use text analysis to study the agenda-setting power of U.S. federal agency budget proposals and congressional appropriations sub-committee reports by &lt;a href=&#34;budgets&#34;&gt;modeling dynamic relationships among texts&lt;/a&gt;. I collect and clean a corpus of texts and develop computational methods to detect influence across political texts that enable novel studies of influence in policymaking. I find that changes in party control substantially affect the text of budget documents, suggesting that the policy effects of budget documents go far beyond the numbers they contain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;environmental-policy&#34;&gt;Environmental policy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my dissertation&amp;rsquo;s substantive focus on environmental policy, I have two collaborative projects examining the role of private actors in global environmental governance. In processes resembling governmental policymaking, private actors exercise governing authority with varying levels of public participation. My article in &lt;em&gt;Organisation &amp;amp; The Environment&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;fsc-sfi&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do Private Regulations Ratchet Up?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;) with Ben Cashore and Constance McDermott clarifies debates in the private governance literature by offering methods to measure regulatory stringency. Using these methods, we compare the forest management practices required by the activist-backed Forest Stewardship Council and industry-backed Sustainable Forestry Initiative. Overall, we find the activist-backed requirements to be increasingly more prescriptive. These competing private regulations did ratchet up, but they simultaneously diverged. We show how various studies had correctly arrived at opposite conclusions by focusing on different dimensions of regulatory stringency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another project on the role of private actors in shaping policy with Irene Scher and Ben Cashore assesses the role of U.S. advocacy groups in shaping Canada&amp;rsquo;s forestry regulations. Tracing the history and policy process leading to the world&amp;rsquo;s largest conservation initiative, the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement, we argue that while &amp;ldquo;Big Green&amp;rdquo; NGOs claimed credit, local First Nations groups had laid the necessary groundwork. This work was published as a peer-reviewed book chapter, &amp;ldquo;Non-domestic Sources of Canadian Boreal Forest Policy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
