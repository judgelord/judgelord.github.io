      <description>&lt;p&gt;I study policymaking, interest groups, congressional oversight and representation, and environmental politics. My current book project focuses on how civic engagement through public pressure campaigns affects agency rulemaking, especially climate and environmental justice campaigns. I examine who participates in public pressure campaigns and why, whether they affect congressional oversight, and whether they affect policy. I also have large collaborative projects investigating legislator behavior and private environmental governance. My work employs a range of quantitative and qualitative methods, with contributions mostly in the field of text analysis. By building open-source datasets and methods to analyze large volumes of political texts, I try to expand the aspects of democracy that are open to systematic study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;public-pressure-and-policymaking&#34;&gt;Public pressure and policymaking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current book project, &lt;em&gt;Public Pressure&lt;/em&gt;, shows how civic engagement through public pressure campaigns affects executive-branch policymaking, with special attention to climate and environmental justice campaigns. Five parts address (1) why groups mobilize public pressure, (2) how it affects congressional oversight, (3) how it influences policy, (4) how it reframes policy debate, and (5) how it affects judicial review. Answering these questions clarifies the role of interest group lobbying, organizing, and mobilizing tactics in policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 90 percent of U.S. law now made by federal agencies, understanding the politics of bureaucratic policymaking is critical to understanding our democracy. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Thousands of agency rules published every year present opportunities to study how groups organize to shape policy across institutions and over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agency rulemaking is a technocratic policy process in which participation is usually limited to a few policy insiders. Occasionally, however, public pressure campaigns make agency rules some of the most hotly contested policies of our time. Yet, leading theories of bureaucratic policymaking neither explain nor account for these fitful bursts of civic engagement. To remedy this, I develop and test theories about the roles of individuals, organizations, coalitions, and political movements in bureaucratic policymaking. I show that pressure campaigns build movements, attract policymakers&#39; attention, and systematically counter corporate power. At the same time, I find that the impact of pressure campaigns is contingent on the capacity of interest groups to mobilize and of policymakers to process political information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I draw on work on social movements and interest group lobbying to develop a theory explaining why different organizations mobilize public pressure. I argue that pressure campaigns are a form of conflict expansion that advantages coalitions with broader public support, not the narrow private interests that dominate policymaking. To assess this theory, I analyze millions of public comments on thousands of agency rules to develop the first systematic measures of public engagement in bureaucratic policymaking. I find that &lt;a href=&#34;whymail&#34;&gt;most public comments are mobilized by public interest coalitions&lt;/a&gt;. However, because expanding the scope of conflict takes significant organizational capacity, campaigns are dominated by large advocacy organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, building on theories of political oversight, I theorize that mass engagement in bureaucratic policymaking can alert elected officials to political risks and opportunities, thus affecting oversight behaviors. I assess this argument by analyzing correspondence between members of Congress and agency officials on proposed rules with and without mass engagement. I find that public pressure campaigns are correlated with congressional attention and that &lt;a href=&#34;oversight&#34;&gt;coalitions with more active congressional support are more likely to achieve their policy goals&lt;/a&gt; in agency rulemaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I integrate intuitions about outside lobbying and oversight into a broader theory of how public pressure may affect policy by producing potentially influential &lt;em&gt;political information&lt;/em&gt;. I suggest and test causal mechanisms by which lobbying may influence policymakers and expand formal models of interest group influence to account for political information. Using &lt;a href=&#34;iterative&#34;&gt;an iterative mix of hand-coding and computational text analysis methods&lt;/a&gt; to measure lobbying success for over 40 million commenters, I find evidence that pressure campaigns indirectly affect policy by mobilizing members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, I contribute to the literature on the effects of political movements on policy through case studies of campaigns channeling demands of the climate and environmental justice movements. I find that &lt;a href=&#34;ej&#34;&gt;when groups raise distributive justice concerns, final rules more often change to address these concerns&lt;/a&gt;. Supporting theories about how institutions affect receptivity to issue frames, agencies with processes for addressing environmental justice are more responsive. The scale of mobilization also matters; when larger coalitions raise environmental justice concerns, policy texts are more likely to change. However, within the movement, elite organizations have more lobbying success. These findings suggest that who makes distributive justice claims, their alignment with institutional biases, and levels of public pressure all systematically affect policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final empirical chapter shows that &lt;a href=&#34;deference&#34;&gt;rules targeted by pressure campaigns were less likely to be struck down by the Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; than rules that received less public attention. This supports the theory that the scale of public attention to policy issues affects judicial decisions because Justices care about public perceptions and the legitimacy of the Court. The book concludes with policy recommendations for increasing the capacity of government institutions in all three branches to process, vet, and learn from what I call &amp;ldquo;political information&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;including public demands expressed through civic engagement and pressure campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;additional-projects-on-agency-rulemaking&#34;&gt;Additional projects on agency rulemaking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my book project, I have several large collaborative projects on agency rulemaking. In a recent article in &lt;em&gt;Interest Groups and Advocacy&lt;/em&gt;, my coauthors and I outline several broad &lt;a href=&#34;regdata&#34;&gt;research agendas on bureaucratic policymaking and opportunities to tackle them with new data&lt;/a&gt;. With various groups of coauthors, I am pursuing many of these opportunities. Many of these projects utilize research collected for my book project. For example, one paper leverages a massive new dataset on all organizations that lobbied on financial regulation following the Dodd-Frank Act. Building on recent landmark work documenting inequality in American politics, we show that wealthy organizations are much more likely to participate in and influence agency rulemaking. We then assess mechanisms that explain the relationship between wealth and policy influence, finding that &lt;a href=&#34;finreg&#34;&gt;wealthier organizations are more influential because they engage in more sophisticated lobbying&lt;/a&gt;. Another paper, with Susan Yackee, leverages the first large-scale data on the agenda-setting politics of producing initial draft rules (the starting point for all previous quantitative studies of timing, duration, and delay in rulemaking). These data allow us to study rulemaking across pre- and post-draft rule stages. We find that the effects of presidential transitions on agency policymaking are even larger for rules that have yet to be announced than in the period between draft and final rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;congressional-oversight-and-representation&#34;&gt;Congressional oversight and representation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second research agenda explains variation in how legislator represent constituents in various interactions with the bureaucracy from constituency service to policy oversight. Beyond my book chapter on how &lt;a href=&#34;oversight&#34;&gt;pressure campaigns mobilize congressional oversight&lt;/a&gt;, my work on legislator behavior includes several coauthored articles, a collaborative book project, and a massive ongoing data collection effort. From this vantage point of detailed observation of legislator offices, our book project addresses how Congress is working, who is left behind, who is getting extra attention, and how to make it better. Through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests, web scraping, and data wrangling, my coauthors, research assistants, and I have assembled and hand-coded over half a million letters, emails, and phone calls from members of Congress to federal agencies. These new data allow new tests of theories of legislator behavior. For example, in the first peer-reviewed publication from this project, we show that &lt;a href=&#34;ferc&#34;&gt;legislators who receive more campaign donations from energy companies are more likely to intervene to support those companies in regulatory and permitting issues&lt;/a&gt;. Another paper, currently under review, shows that &lt;a href=&#34;correspondence&#34;&gt;legislators prioritize policy work as they gain experience and institutional power, but, simultaneously, their increased capacity also allows them to maintain absolute levels of constituency service&lt;/a&gt;. Another working paper shows that &lt;a href=&#34;correp&#34;&gt;legislators provide constituency service seniors and veterans in proportion to populations in their district, but low-income constituencies do not receive proportionate constituency service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;environmental-governance&#34;&gt;Environmental governance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my main book projects&amp;rsquo;s substantive focus on environmental policy, I have two collaborative projects examining the role of private actors in global environmental governance. In processes resembling governmental policymaking, private actors exercise governing authority with varying levels of public participation. In an article in &lt;em&gt;Organisation &amp;amp; Environment&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;fsc-sfi&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do Private Regulations Ratchet Up?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;) my coauthors and I clarify debates in the private governance literature by offering methods to measure regulatory stringency. We show how various studies arrived at opposite conclusions by focusing on different dimensions of regulatory stringency. We then compare the forest management practices required by the activist-backed Forest Stewardship Council and industry-backed Sustainable Forestry Initiative using the new methods we propose. We find that these competing private regulations did ratchet up but also simultaneously diverged&amp;mdash;with the activist-backed requirements increasingly more prescriptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another project on the role of private actors in shaping policy with Irene Scher and Ben Cashore assesses the role of U.S. advocacy groups in shaping Canada&amp;rsquo;s forestry regulations. Tracing the policy process leading to the world&amp;rsquo;s largest conservation initiative, the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement, we argue that while &amp;ldquo;Big Green&amp;rdquo; NGOs claimed credit, local First Nations groups had laid the necessary groundwork. This work was published as a peer-reviewed book chapter, &amp;ldquo;Non-domestic Sources of Canadian Boreal Forest Policy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second nascent project follows from my work on how groups organize around opportunities for public participation. Following the causal chain, I am exploring how opportunities to participate in policymaking affect group formation, organization, and mobilization. Whereas most policy feedback literature traces the effects of legislation on voters, this project will examine how procedural policy tools like notice and comment rulemaking mobilize and demobilize organized groups.  &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
